<p class="ph1">MY UNCLE&#8217;S SCHEME.</p>



<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;It has been found hard to describe man by an
adequate definition. Some philosophers have called
him a reasonable animal; but others have considered
reason as a quality of which many creatures partake.
He has been termed likewise a laughing animal; but
it is said that some men have never laughed. Perhaps
man may be more properly distinguished as an idle
animal.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Dr. Johnson.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> father was a major in the army who,
at the time this story begins, had lived in
Longueville-sur-mer for fifteen years, to
which place he had come, after my mother&#8217;s
death, bringing me with him. I was then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
seven years old. He put me to a good
school in the neighbourhood, at which I
remained until I was sixteen; and was
then let free. Considering myself a man,
I worked hard to grow a mustache, in
which I very ignominiously failed; for it
was not until I was one-and-twenty that
nature condescended to favour me with
that very elegant and martial decoration.
I also took to colouring meerschaum pipes,
in which art, before I was nineteen, I was
considered by my companions to excel,
though I did not succeed in establishing
my reputation in that line until I had
dealt such an injury to my nervous system
as I fear I shall never recover. I also
became, before long, an expert hand at
billiards, though up to the last Bob Le
Marchmont could always give me twenty
points and beat me comfortably. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
was his better at whist, and was indeed
a match for several grave old gentlemen
who were members of our English Club
in the Rue des Chiens.</p>

<p>My father was a remarkably handsome
man, with a nose like Lord Chatham&#8217;s and
with whiskers which I would liken to two
solid bastions of hair, richly dyed and
inexorably curled. A whiter hand than
his never embellished a cuff. He stood
six feet in his stockings, and well do
I remember Sub-lieutenant Delplanque
saying to me &#8220;Mon cher, one may stitch
pokers instead of whalebone into one&#8217;s stays,
and still fail to achieve the air magnificent
and CÃ¦saresque that distinguishes le
major Argrrrarve.&#8221; I was once walking on
the <i>port</i>, as they call the quay, with my
father, when Louis Napoleon drove past
us; His Majesty was in mufti, and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
father would not have known him had not
the Emperor deigned to raise his hat.
The compliment was an imperial one, and
my father would relate the incident with
exquisite satisfaction. Jack Sturt said
&#8220;it was foreign majesty paying homage to
British arms&mdash;and legs.&#8221; To which I
added, &#8220;God save the Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that after I left
school my father ought to have put me
to one of the professions, or entered me
in a house of business. He had two
brothers, one of whom owned a private
bank, the other was a retired stock-broker;
and either of them, as they afterwards
told me, would have been very glad to
take me by the hand, had my father
applied to them. But he was by nature
a reckless man: by reckless I mean that
he never troubled himself about the future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
(though he lived strictly within his half-pay).
He hated trouble of any kind or
description. If ever he reflected upon the
future, he could scarcely, I am sure,
understand that it should mean more than
a perpetual succession of morning strolls,
and afternoon siestas, and evening whist
parties. He pursued day after day, with
automatic regularity, a small round of
trifling and monotonous distractions, which
by degrees girdled his existence with the
narrowest possible horizon, and prevented
him from sympathising with any needs
which, like mine, lay outside the sphere
of his daily routine.</p>

<p>I do not say I was not as much or
more to blame. Had I teazed him, he
would no doubt have made an effort to
get me out of Longueville into some
calling in England. To speak the truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
I liked my life so well that I had no
wish to change. Monotony has its fascination.
We cling to dulness after many
years of habitude. Don&#8217;t you know people
who have, to your certain knowledge, made
up their minds for the last ten years to
leave the place they live in? Year after
year the same story is told&mdash;how they
hate the society; how inhospitable the
neighbours are; how low the town has
become since their day: how every stone
in every street is as familiar to them as
their faces; how unspeakably nauseating the
people who live opposite, and who overlook
all their internal doings, make life by the
sickening regularity of their habits. But
your grumbling friends still go on living
in the same place; and all they do, and
all they probably ever will do, is to amuse
their resolution to quit with fictitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
inspections of houses they don&#8217;t mean to
take, and occasional applications for lists
to distant house-agents, with whom they
have not the slightest intention of transacting
any business. Over and over again
I would say, &#8220;I&#8217;d give anything to get
out of this hole;&#8221; and no man&#8217;s voice
more loudly swelled the residential chorus
of abuse against Longueville than mine.
But I never meant what I said. In the
depths of my soul dwelt a very pathetic
love for our apartments, with the faded
velvet furniture and ghastly skeleton clock
and antique mirrors, over Auguste Soulier&#8217;s
the bootmaker&#8217;s shop in the Rue d&#8217;Enghien;
for the pastry-cook&#8217;s opposite, where, when
a boy, I would spend my pocket-money
in <i>pistaches</i> and tarts, and where, when
grown too nice for raw sweetmeats and
jam, I would dawdle over Vanilla ices; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the billiard table in the CafÃ© Grenouille
over whose worn cloth I have stooped
with an enthusiasm that, directed into a
money-making channel, would have earned
me a good income; for the whist tables
in the club-room, where, amid volumes of
smoke from cigars, at fifty centimes apiece,
I would make or lose during a long evening
as much as ten sous. And shall I ever
forget&mdash;oh, fond and foolish heart, be still!&mdash;shall
I ever forget thee, sweet Pauline
Gautier&mdash;remind me, was thy father a
dancing-master, or did he keep a school?
Thee, I say, whom on summer evenings
I would row in a boat on the amber-coloured
river, filling the intervals of the
measured music of my oars with tender
breathings, surely not the less delightful
for thee to hear because I whispered them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
in French, not always strictly grammatical?</p>

<p>But, as my father would often say,
aprÃ´pos of nothing, &#8220;Facts, my boy, are
stronger than prejudices;&#8221; and a very undeniable
fact was that, though billiards,
and smoking, and boating, and spooning
by moonlight are highly agreeable pursuits,
they could not in any fashion whatever
contribute to my existence when it
pleased heaven to call my father away. I
wonder I never thought of this. However,
when I was hard upon three-and-twenty,
a change came. This is the story of it.</p>

<p>One morning I saw a letter addressed
to my father lying upon the breakfast-table.
It bore the English post-mark, and
without taking further thought of it I
went to the window and amused myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
with staring out until my father should
enter. Somehow, I have the clearest
recollection of that morning, and of a
trivial incident that made up the life of
the street whilst I looked down upon it.
It was early morning&mdash;nine o&#8217;clock. The
gay sunshine streamed brightly upon the
shop-windows and the white pavement,
and threw a coquettish intelligence upon
the brown and comely features of a smart
<i>femme de chambre</i>, who had thrown up
a window opposite to shake a duster,
which, I took it, she meant to continue
shaking whilst I remained visible. In the
middle of the road were two soldiers,
little red-trowsered men, so neat and small,
you would have said that they had just
been unpacked at the toyman&#8217;s at the
corner. A priest passed, reading a book,
with his eyes in the corners of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
sockets; the little soldiers whipped up
their hands, gave him a salute, and fell
to talking again. <i>Ciel!</i> how they gesticulated,
shrugged, brandished their fists,
smote their breasts, and struck attitudes!
In London a crowd would have surrounded
them in two minutes, and a hundred
pocket-handkerchiefs would have been
lost for ever. Now what were they
grimacing, grinning, grunting, and growling
over? Probably a description. Alphonse
was telling Jules how Auguste had beaten
AmedÃ©e last night at dominoes; the stakes,
sugar-and-water all round, a matter of
<i>cinquante centimes</i>. AmedÃ©e was <i>abimÃ©</i>.
<i>Va pour un croquant!</i> You saw his face
this morning, Jules? <i>Tenez!</i> &#8217;twas green
as grass. This AmedÃ©e bears misfortune
like a Russian. (To-day it would be a
Prussian). Bah! ... here a shrug expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the rest: in which the ears stood
out along the shoulders, in which the
back became a hump, in which the tension
of the corporeal frame lifted the trousers
up the calves, and exhibited everything
but socks&mdash;in which the whole person was
transformed into a rounded twist of silent
eloquence, so convincing that I saw Monsieur
Galette in the pastry-cook&#8217;s shop, nod
his head with a gesture of acute appreciation
of the significance of the martial
convulsion. Thus universally intelligible
in France is the language of contortion.</p>

<p>As the soldiers walked off, gesticulating
as if at any moment they would throw
their caps down and fight it out, in came
my father, took up the letter, pulled out
his glasses, and having read a little,
called out&mdash;</p>



<p>&#8220;Charlie, here&#8217;s news for you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Grove End, Updown</span>,<br />

&#8220;May &mdash;, 18&mdash;.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,</p>

<p>&#8220;I was very glad to get your letter,
for, guessing roughly, I should say it is
not a day less than four years since I
last heard from you. You hate the sea;
yet you managed to cross the Channel
once; can&#8217;t you cross it again and spend
a few weeks with us?&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent">(My father shook his head.)</p>

<p>&#8220;I can give you some capital Burgundy,
my cook knows her work, and though
society here is rather drab-coloured, I
can pick you out enough people to keep
you well stocked with rubbers.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">(&#8220;He would have to entertain a corpse,&#8221;
said my father. &#8220;The crossing would
kill me&mdash;especially if it were calm&mdash;for
then <i>all</i> the filth of the engine-room is
tasted.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;And now to business,&#8221; continued the
letter. &#8220;You want to place your son.
Would he like to be a banker&#8217;s clerk?&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent">(&#8220;No,&#8221; said I; but my father took no
notice.)</p>

<p>&#8220;One of my clerks is leaving me. His
salary is Â£100. I will make it Â£150 for
your son, if he will come. He can either
live in lodgings or with us. He may
prefer the former; but I think he will
find our house more comfortable than any
apartments he can get at Updown. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
place will be vacant next week, and he
can join when he likes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Richard was with me last month.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent">(&#8220;Poor Dick!&#8221; said my father; &#8220;we
haven&#8217;t met for twenty years!&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know that he has changed
his quarters, and purchased an estate at
Shandon?&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent">(&#8220;Tom told me that Dick had retired
on Â£40,000,&#8221; said my father, looking at
me over his glasses.)</p>

<p>&#8220;He has grown very corpulent, and
hankers after his old trade. A gain of
Â£10 makes him giddy with joy; and he
will forget, amid his transports, that he
lost a hundred or more last account. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
daughter Theresa has grown a fine woman.
I shall be curious to see your son, who
scarcely reached to my knee when I last
saw him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife and Constance send all
manner of kind messages.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="indentright">&#8220;Believe me, dear Charles,</span><br />
<span class="indentright2">&#8220;Your affectionate brother,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Thomas Hargrave</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;What is all this about?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;About?&#8221; cried my father: &#8220;why,
about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you write? You didn&#8217;t
tell me you had done so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I wasn&#8217;t sure that anything
would come of it. Why, this is from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
your uncle Tom. Didn&#8217;t you know you
had such an uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I knew&mdash;but what made
you write?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; answered my father,
pulling off his glasses. &#8220;Last Monday
evening I had a talk with Harris at the
Club. Harris is a man I respect. I
consider Harris,&#8221; said my father with
emphasis, &#8220;an honest man. He spoke
of you. &#8216;Major,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I think
Charlie is too fine a fellow to be allowed
to run to seed in a place like this?&#8217;
&#8216;I&#8217;ll own, Harris,&#8217; said I, &#8216;that it has
sometimes struck me my son might be
doing better.&#8217; He then asked me, why
I didn&#8217;t get you into some house of
business in London. This sort of questions
are very easily put. There&#8217;s no
difficulty in asking a subaltern why he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
isn&#8217;t a field-marshal, or a poor man why
he don&#8217;t invent something wonderful,
and make a fortune. &#8216;The fact is,&#8217; said
I, &#8216;I have no interest in the City. I
don&#8217;t think,&#8217; I said, quite forgetting my
brother Tom for the moment, &#8216;that I
have a single friend in business.&#8217; &#8216;Well,
major,&#8217; said Harris, &#8216;your boy and I are
old friends: he&#8217;s a thorough Englishman
and a gentleman, and has done nothing
that I can see to deserve expatriation.
I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do. I have a
brother&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; &#8216;Faith Harris,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I
am truly obliged to you, but I can&#8217;t
permit you to do for me what it is my
duty, at all events, to try to do for
myself. You&#8217;ve reminded me that I, too,
have a brother who owns a private bank.
By George!&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;(my father always swore
like a gentleman)&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll write to him!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
I have never asked either of my brothers
a favour in my life; and I don&#8217;t suppose
Tom will refuse me a first and last
request.&#8217; So, without saying a word to
you, I sent a letter to Tom, asking his
interest for you. I don&#8217;t know how it
strikes you&mdash;but <i>I</i> never could have
expected so handsome a reply after so
long a silence. Why, he has answered
me by return of post,&#8221; said my father,
peering at the date.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no doubt he is very kind,&#8221; I
answered, wishing both him and old
Harris at Jericho. &#8220;But I haven&#8217;t any
particular wish to leave here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True, but this is no place for a
young man. What&#8217;s your age? Three-and-twenty.
My dear boy, at three-and-twenty
William Pitt was First Lord of
the Treasury. What you have to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
is, I am fifty years old&#8221; (50 + 12),
&#8220;and at fifty a man is no longer
young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said I, somewhat impressed,
for these were considerations that,
so far as I could remember, had never
before disturbed either of us.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I die,&#8221; continued my father, &#8220;my
pay dies with me. I have saved nothing&mdash;what
have I to save? This is not so
cheap a place to live in as people think.
There was, indeed, a time when ten francs
would purchase poultry enough to stock
a hotel for a week, but now I can scarcely
put a pair of fowls on my table for that
money. When I die, what is to become
of you? If you don&#8217;t think of that now,
you will find yourself in a muddle some
of these days. Tom can be the making
of you if he likes. A hundred and fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
a year, let me tell you, is a very handsome
beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but a banker&#8217;s clerk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t call yourself that. You&#8217;ll
be known as your uncle&#8217;s nephew, and I
should always speak of you as a banker.
And after all, what does it signify what
you&#8217;re called, so long as you have prospects?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I can&#8217;t do any good by remaining
here,&#8221; said I, gloomily; &#8220;but that
doesn&#8217;t make me want to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Man,&#8221; answered my father with the
solemnity of a Rasselas, &#8220;is not a vegetable.
Legs were given him to walk with,
and the world was made for him to look at.
As we advance in life our wants dwindle
to a point. No man could ever have
started with more copious aspirations than
I did, and now whist is the one solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
pleasure that satisfies me. I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;
he continued, stroking his fine whiskers,
&#8220;how it came about that I never thought
of sending a line to Tom about you
before. Answer his letter after breakfast,
and take care to thank him for his
kindness. I consider his offer a very
handsome one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully sudden,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Indeed it was: and I thought it hard
that I should be called upon to act and
decide for myself without having received
one word of warning that a change was
to take place. It was not to be expected
that I could let fall at once those prejudices
in favour of an idle life which had
been the accumulation of six years of
steady inactivity.</p>

<p>&#8220;All good fortune is sudden,&#8221; said my
father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>&#8220;Do <i>you</i> mean to accept the invitation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; apart from my horror of the sea,
I should prefer that you entered life
alone. There is a dignity in solitude&mdash;a
suggestion of self-dependence, my boy,
that all men of the world admire. Of
course on your arrival you will assure
everybody of my affectionate and brotherly
sentiments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t mind anything else but a
banker&#8217;s clerk!&#8221; I grumbled. &#8220;Roget&#8217;s
a banker&#8217;s clerk, and what a snob he
is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Roget&#8217;s a Frenchman. Don&#8217;t confound
monkeys with men. Always be
lordly in your estimates of what you are
about. I always was. Nothing gave me
greater delight than to be magnificent in
trifles. I have read of a composer who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
invariably sat down to write in full court
dress, with fine lace ruffles on, and
diamond rings. That was a great man.
Let your personal characteristics, if you
have any, overtop and overwhelm every
consideration that seems in anywise mercenary
or humble. Sink the Thing in the
Man! Beau Brummel behind a counter
showing scarves to gentlemen or silks
to ladies, would make haberdasherising a
gorgeous calling, fit for monarchs to
pursue. If I were a banker&#8217;s clerk, the
whole profession should feel themselves
dignified by the accession of a man in
whose rich and sumptuous individuality
all paltry conditions of his employment
should be merged, sunk, and annihilated!&#8221;</p>

<p>Saying which, he gave me a magnificent
nod, and looked at himself in the
glass.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&#8220;Happen what will,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I&#8217;ll live
in lodgings. I suppose I shall be fearfully
hardworked: but what time I have
to myself, I mean to be free in. For
anything I can tell, my aunt may hate
the smell of tobacco. Perhaps uncle
Tom is a one-pipe man, who blows his
cloud up the kitchen-chimney. A pleasant
look-out for a fellow like me, to
find himself in a house, where, after tea,
the wife pulls out &#8216;Emma,&#8217; or &#8216;Cecilia,&#8217;
and reads aloud, whilst the husband
snorts in an arm-chair, and the daughter
works at an altar cloth! Bed at half-past
nine&mdash;a knock at your door at a
quarter to ten, with a shrill request to
put your light out, as master&#8217;s afraid of
fire. No boiled mutton and near relations
for me! I&#8217;d rather be a missionary
than endure that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>&#8220;By all means live in lodgings,&#8221; said
my father, who, I could see, reflected
with horror upon the picture I had drawn.
&#8220;A hundred and fifty a year ought to
get you some good wine and cigars, and
I don&#8217;t see what the deuce is to upset
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can but try banking, and
see how I like it,&#8221; said I, dolefully,
accommodating my prejudices after the
established fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll like it,&#8221; answered my
father. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going among
strangers: and Tom is too much my
brother, I hope, not to know what is
due to relations and gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Celestine brought in the coffee
and omelettes, and we sat down to
breakfast.</p>

<p>Of course you guess that I did as my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
father bade me, and accepted my uncle&#8217;s
offer with an abundance of artificial gratitude.
Really grateful I could not be.
I was content to remain as I was, as I
have told you, and heartily wished my
uncle hanged for his kindness. Nor was
I at all well-pleased to be reminded of
my prospective necessities. What business
had Harris to remind my father to
tell me that, when he died, I should be
a beggar? This was a most objectionable
truth: a bold, naked, confounded fact,
which, when I was made to look at it,
I could not blink; which rendered work
necessary; and which enforced my acceptance
of uncle Tom&#8217;s offer. &#8220;Ah, my
Pauline!&#8221; I remember thinking that
evening as I wandered companionless
around the stand on which the
band of the Hundred Guards were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
playing, as only <i>it</i> can play, &#8220;Ah, my
Pauline, would that I had but thy papa&#8217;s
income, which, as he once assured me in
a moment of supreme confidence, amounted
to two thousand francs! Small are my
wants and thine! What luxuries and
bliss unspeakable were ours on two thousand
francs of rent! Is not thine a smile
that would make soupe maigre&mdash;accursed
beverage!&mdash;more exquisite to the palate
than turtle-soup? Hast thou not eyes
whose sweet fires would give to the thinnest
ordinaire the ruby radiance and the
Paradisaical aroma of Burgundy&#8217;s vintage?&#8221;
Was love a reason for my reluctance
to leave Longueville? I almost
forget. Seldom is the memory tenacious
of early indiscretions, or, as a Scotchman
said to me once, with intense gravity,
&#8220;Sir, we forget what we canna remember.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
I contrast those sighs I have just
recorded with the emotions with which
I surveyed Pauline last summer. <i>Que
voulez vous?</i> She keeps a hotel. Fat?
was she fat? Mr. Banting might have
been cut out of her, and still left her a
stout woman. I did not know her. Fat
annihilates idealism, and I might as well
have hunted for a vision of loveliness in
the lump of marble which the sculptor
has not yet struck, as have sought for
the Pauline of my youth, the Pauline of
my moonlight boating trips, the Pauline
of the black eyes and little waist, in the
Dutch and shaking rotundity that filled me,
as I gazed, with mingled emotions of alarm
and amazement. She knew me, and gasped
out her name and&mdash;pouff! let me blow
these recollections away. I have a story
to tell of which Pauline is not the heroine.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>So figure to yourself that I have bidden
my father and a group of friends,
in deer-stalking hats and tight pantaloons,
good-bye, and that I am standing near
the man at the wheel, who is steering
the &#8220;King of the French&#8221; out through
the piers, and that I continue waving my
handkerchief to everybody who will look,
until the town sinks behind the cliffs,
and the piers melt into thin lines. Then
I gaze ahead, and see nothing but a
broad expanse of blue leaping water,
through which the steamer cuts her way,
straight for a cloud, a vague white cloud
upon the horizon, which a Frenchman
near me tells Madame, his wife, is &#8220;Le
cliffs to Shak-ess-pear, comedian Angleesh.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Take my word for it, when relations choose to be
obliging, they&#8217;re better friends than any a man can make
for himself.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Vagrant.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> to change carriages at Canterbury
in order to get to Updown, which was
twelve miles distant from that city. I
felt as lonely as a German who can&#8217;t
speak a word of English, and who must
either make his way from Leicester Square
to Mile End Gate, or starve. A guard
took me for a foreigner, perhaps a fire-worshipper,
because I had to get him to
repeat a question three times before I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
had the faintest idea of his meaning. I
will put it to the most intelligent of my
readers&mdash;if a man with a face like the
countenance of a skate, were to thrust his
head into a window and roar with a
voice turbid with hops, &#8220;F-r-sh-f-rd-s-r!&#8221;
what would you think? Would you call
for the police; or fall back, and resignedly
give yourself up for lost? What I
gathered after a bold and narrow cross-examination
was, that the man, who enjoyed
his right senses, wanted an answer
to this question: &#8220;Are you for Ashford,
sir?&#8221; Considering that I look as much
an Englishman as blue eyes, a fair complexion,
and a yellow, or auburn, or red,
or tawny (take your choice; they all
mean one colour) mustache can make a
man; and considering, moreover, that I
could articulate the national dialect in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
manner Dr. Johnson himself&mdash;his immortal
name, I am proud to say, heads chapter
one&mdash;would have held unimpeachable, I
maintain that I had a right to consider
myself aggrieved, by being set down as a
foreigner, by a man who looked like a
fish, and spoke like a Yahoo. Ever since
that day I have possessed, and I hope I
shall always preserve, an unaffected sympathy
with foreigners travelling in England.
No wonder Alphonse Tassard, after a fortnight&#8217;s
trip to Great Britain&mdash;he having
set out with the intention of returning
in four days&mdash;swore with many wild and
awful imprecations, that he would rather
travel round Dante&#8217;s fearful circles, than
make a tour in Albion. For, had not a
London cabman taken him to the North-Western
Railway Station instead of to the
South-Eastern Railway Station; and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
not a <i>sot</i> put him into a carriage that
whirled him into the furnaces of the
Black Country, instead of to the southern
port, whence he had hoped to embark for
his hair-dressing establishment in the Rue
de Poitrine?</p>

<p>The train stopped at Updown station,
and out I jumped, leaving behind me,
in my eagerness to escape from being
carried any further, a new silk umbrella
with an ivory handle. (This is intended
to meet the eye of a melancholy looking
man who sat opposite to me.) My
portmanteau, which might have been full
of priceless Dresden ware for anything
the guard knew, was hurled out of the
van on to the platform, where it gave a
bound and stood upright, the engine
screeched, off went the train, and I was
left staring at a short man with a waistcoat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
that descended considerably below
his middle, who, on catching my eye, fell
to poking his forehead rapidly with his
thumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hargrave, sir?&#8221; said he interrogatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my name,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from your uncle, if you please,
sir. The phaeton&#8217;s awaitin&#8217; outside. Is
that all your luggage, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The groom or coachman, or whatever
he was, pounced upon the portmanteau,
hoisted it on to his shoulders, and led
the way out of the station into a green
lane, where stood a neat little trap, into
which he bade me jump. I was not fond
of jumping. All my traditions were
opposed to violent exercise. I clambered
leisurely on to the front seat, my companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
seized the reins, and the smart
chestnut mare, lustrous with brass-mounted
harness, started off at a quick trot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going to drive me
to?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Mr. Hargrave&#8217;s, sir,&#8221; replied the
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know if he has procured any
lodgings for me in the town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t say, sir. Master ordered
me to drive you to Grove End. Them
was my orders, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wondered if it could be possible that
my uncle had determined I should live
in his house? I was resolved that no
tyranny of hospitality should tame me
into submission. I had made up my mind
to live in lodgings, and nothing human,
I said to myself, shall induce me to
abandon that resolution. How was I to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
know the sort of treatment I might have
to submit to? Mightn&#8217;t the butler&mdash;if
they kept one&mdash;sneer at me from behind
his master&#8217;s chair, and flatter himself
that there was no comparison between
the respectability of his position as a
butler, and mine as a banker&#8217;s clerk?
Mightn&#8217;t my aunt send me upon menial
errands, treat me as a kind of upper footman,
and if I remonstrated, inquire with
a scowl what I thought her husband
gave me a hundred and fifty pounds a
year for?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was being driven through
a country so exceedingly pretty, that in
the face of it, my fretful and feverish
fancies died away, and I found myself
incapable of more than admiration. Updown,
the coachman told me, was three
miles from the station. We had driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
a mile by this time, but I could see
nothing of the town. The country was
hilly, with ridges richly shagged with
wood. It was a glorious May afternoon,
with a warm breeze that swept by, charged
with indescribable aromas, and with the
most delicate blue sky that ever I saw,
across which great bright clouds were
rolling, dimming the sun at intervals, and
mellowing and deepening with shadows
the manifold colours of hills and plains.
We had long ago left the green lane and
were now bowling along a very good
turnpike road, which rose and fell as far
as the horizon behind us, but which grew
very devious and vanishing as we
advanced. I was struck by the air of
cultivated beauty the country exhibited.
I had never seen anything like it about
Longueville. I noticed the vivid green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of the grass, the sturdy and sheltering
aspect of the trees, the cosiness and permanency
of the farm-houses and wayside
buildings, and the rugged and vigorous
frames of the country people we overtook
and passed. Presently we rattled
over a broad bridge, and I looked along
a bright river with so smooth a surface
that the shores were as accurately mirrored
in it as if it had been a looking-glass.
I thought of Izaak Walton and
hearty, cheerful Mr. Cotton, and wondered
if they had ever thrown their quills in
that water; and as the &#8220;Compleat Angler&#8221;
was a book I had often read, and was
passionately fond of, it is not surprising
that the rich and sweet description
of Maudlin, and her syllabubs and
song, should come into my memory to
gild the brief glimpse I had caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
with the radiance of an imperishable
poem.</p>

<p>On coming to a bend of the road, I
saw on my right the red roofs and church
spires and glittering vanes, and smoking
chimneys of a town built on the sloping
sides of two hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that Updown?&#8221; I asked. The
coachman said it was. I gazed at it with
interest. Distance softened all rude and
commonplace details, and, in the silver
sunshine, the town looked fairy-like.
The central street, which ran straight as
a line through the heart of the valley,
was made wonderfully picturesque by a
great archway. We branched off just as
we were getting near enough to see the
houses distinctly, and, in about ten
minutes, drove through a gate, along a
pleasant avenue, and stopped before an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
exceedingly pretty house, with gleaming
conservatories on either side, and hedged
about with a great profusion of shrubbery.
I saw a girl&#8217;s face at one of
the windows, and, in a moment or two,
the door was thrown open, and forth
stepped&mdash;my uncle: a spare, dry-faced
man, with very high shirt-collars, and a
very shiny black satin cravat, and dressed
in a suit of shepherd&#8217;s plaid. Of course
I had no idea who he was, for there was
no more resemblance between him and
my father than there was between his
coachman and me. But the moment
he smiled, I knew he must be a Hargrave.</p>

<p>I got out of the phaeton, and he came
up to me, and took my hand, and held
it without speaking, whilst he ran his
eye over me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>&#8220;And <i>you</i> are Charlie, are you?&#8221;
cried he, not letting go my hand, but,
on the contrary, proceeding to shake it
slowly and persistently. &#8220;Good heaven!
how old the world must be getting!
Why, it was only the other day that
you came up to my knee, and now,
egad! it seems as if I only came up to
yours! Do you remember me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very faintly,&#8221; said I. &#8220;You came
to Longueville once, when I was at
school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes! and I got you a half-holiday,
and you wheedled a half-crown
out of me! ha! ha! and how&#8217;s
my brother, the major? Does he ever
mean to come and see me?... But
what do <i>I</i> mean by keeping you standing
here? Hi! James, carry Mr. Hargrave&#8217;s
portmanteau into the hall.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>And catching me by the arm, he led
me up the steps, and through the hall
into a drawing-room full of flowers and
china&mdash;so it appeared to me&mdash;calling
&#8220;Conny! Conny!&#8221; loudly as we passed
in.</p>

<p>Scarcely were we entered, when two
ladies presented themselves. I felt travel-worn
and soiled, and wished my uncle
had given me an opportunity of making
myself a little fresher-looking before introducing
me to his wife and daughter.
I made a low bow and took my aunt&#8217;s
hand; she welcomed me in a very mild
and pleasing manner. My cousin Conny
then came up to me and shook my hand,
looking very shy and charming. <i>She</i> was
exceedingly pretty. Up to that time, I
don&#8217;t think I had ever seen her equal.
As to Pauline Gautier&mdash;pshaw! There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
was no comparison to be made. Pauline
was brown; Conny had a skin of snow,
and hair of gold, and large, modest, dark
blue eyes, and a sweet and saucy nose,
and a small mouth, and a transporting
figure. I can&#8217;t describe the dress she
wore. No man but a shopkeeper ought
to be able to describe a woman&#8217;s costume.
Shall I tell you why? because a
woman&#8217;s style ought to be too perfect for
a man to notice details. Depend upon
it, there is something gross in that woman&#8217;s
taste, whose dress, after leaving her, a
man is able to describe.</p>

<p>My aunt was a stout, healthy-looking
woman, red-cheeked, with a most amiable
cast of countenance. I was impressed by
the size of her cap, and her walk, which
was a waddle. My uncle pushed a chair
forwards for me to be seated; he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the ladies then ranged themselves round
me, and we began to converse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was delighted to hear from my
brother. How is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well indeed. He begged me to
thank you heartily for the kindness of
your offer to me, and to convey his love
to you and Mrs. Hargrave, and your
daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a time he has lived at Longueville!
Isn&#8217;t he sick of the place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We are both of us very fond
of Longueville. I left it with great
regret, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted papa to take us there this
summer,&#8221; said Conny, timidly, and then
starting; like Fear in Collins&#8217; Ode, at the
sound she herself had made.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dread the water, Mr. Charles,&#8221;
observed my aunt.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>&#8220;And so does my father, or he would
have been glad to accept your kind invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it long since you were in England?&#8221;
asked Conny.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not been in England since I
was six years old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you must be a perfect Frenchman!&#8221;
cried out my uncle and aunt in
a breath. And then said my uncle:
&#8220;You&#8217;ll find French very useful to you
in business. How do you like the idea
of being a banker?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing about it,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>I was proud of my ignorance. I believed
it would impress Conny. I felt, in
short, like the West-end gentleman who
asked a friend where the city was.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon teach you,&#8221; said my uncle,
cheerily. &#8220;I wish you had made up your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
mind to live with us. I have taken
lodgings for you in the town, as you
desired, but I am sure you would have
been more comfortable here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt disposed to agree with him.
Certainly the house appeared a very
delightful one, and I must say that I
had had no idea I owned such a pretty
cousin as Conny. But still I reflected
that the habits of the old people might
be entirely opposed to mine; and it
would be hideous to have to submit to
any kind of restraint, after the long years
of billiards, tobacco, and freedom I had
enjoyed at Longueville.</p>

<p>&#8220;At all events,&#8221; said my aunt, &#8220;you
can always come here if you don&#8217;t find
your quarters comfortable. Your landlady
was recommended to me by our
laundress, who is a very respectable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
woman; Conny and I inspected your
rooms, before taking them, and they
seem pretty comfortable. They are very
clean, which is a great thing in lodgings.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at Conny, who was watching
me; her eyes fell when mine met them.
There seemed a little more keenness and
slyness in their glance than I should
have thought such innocent, maidenly,
tender, blue eyes capable of. But oh,
Eugenio! what is there more deceitful in
life than a pretty girl? Does thy heart
bleed? Mine has bled. I have tried
to pick a rose, and have pulled away
nothing but four fingers and a thumb
stuffed with thorns.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will dine with us to-day,&#8221; said
my uncle. &#8220;Afterwards, James shall drive
you to your quarters. There is no need
to go to work before Monday. You can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
pass the rest of the week in looking
about you, and sending home your impressions
to my brother, the major, who
I daresay will be anxious to know how
you like the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your kindness,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;will
give me plenty to tell him about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy, we promise to do our
best to make you happy,&#8221; said my uncle
effusively. &#8220;I can assure you, it gives
me great pleasure to be of service to you
and my brother. He ought to have
applied to me before. Had you begun
this sort of work ten years ago, you
might have owned a bank of your own
by this time. But it&#8217;s never too late to
begin, is it?&#8221; and here he smiled, and I
smiled, and my aunt smiled, and my
sweet little cousin laughed a little harping
treble, soft as the notes of a flute heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
on the water at midnight. &#8220;This is very
promising,&#8221; thought I.</p>

<p>My aunt then told her husband to
take me upstairs; it was nearly five,
and dinner would soon be ready. So I
followed my uncle to a bed-room, and
there, as I brushed my hair and curled
my mustache, I wondered what sort of
an impression I had made on my relations.
I thought of my father&#8217;s advice,
and wished I knew how to be as magnificent
as he. He had often told me that
his brothers had a very high respect for
him, and considered him the prop and
decoration of the family name. I thought
this quite likely. People in business <i>do</i>
respect professional relations. Profit and
purple are a fine combination; and if Mr.
Scrip knows that her ladyship would call
upon Mrs. Scrip, were she to hear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the Dean was Mrs. Scrip&#8217;s brother, why
shouldn&#8217;t Scrip brag of the parson, and
combine social dignity with his remunerative
pursuits in Throgmorton Street? I
lamented my inability to imitate my
father&#8217;s lordliness, for then I might have
profited by my relations&#8217; pride in him,
and provoked deference, and even awe,
by repeating in myself those swelling
qualities and overtopping characteristics
which rendered my father among his
acquaintance an object of admiration and
reverence. It is an old saying, that
the world will always take you at your
own price. Cast your eyes around you,
Eugenio, and mark the numbers who are
buying paste for precious stones, and,
albeit, by no means destitute of the
critical faculty, ostentatiously parading the
worthless make-believe in the sincere conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
that they are gems of the purest
ray serene. Any muff can make himself
a considerable man, if he will but shout
long and loud enough to the populace to
step up! step up! and admire! &#8220;Behold
me, gentlemen!&#8221; says the poet through
himself or through his friends. &#8220;I am
not so great a man as Shakespeare, and
I have not Dante&#8217;s austere and morbid
imagination. But it is universally acknowledged
that I combine the sweetness
of Keats and the wisdom of Wordsworth
with the power of Byron and the ghastliness
of Coleridge; and give me leave to
say that the man who can rival these
acknowledged geniuses <i>must</i> be great?&#8221;
&#8220;Hooroor!&#8221; yell the populace. They
believe him; they buy his quarto of nonsense;
and lo! another muff is canonised.</p>

<p>So I maintain that my father was right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
when he exhorted me to treat life as a
court-dress affair. The world is so full
of hero-worshippers, that no man can
think himself too important.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Hardcastle.</i> &#8220;I believe, sir, you must be sensible, sir,
that no man alive ought to be more welcome than
your father&#8217;s son, sir. I hope you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Marlow.</i> &#8220;I do, from my soul, sir. I don&#8217;t want
much entreaty, I generally make my father&#8217;s son
welcome wherever he goes.&#8221;&mdash;<i>She Stoops to Conquer.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">I returned</span> to my uncle and the ladies
in the drawing room. By this time I
felt quite at home, a feeling to which
the improvement effected by the hair-brush
and towel in the <i>coup-d&#8217;&#339;il</i> of my
personal appearance did not a little contribute;
and I could stop to admire.
Addressing myself to my aunt, I complimented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
her upon the beauty of the
grounds, a glimpse of which I could catch
through the windows, and entered easily
into a conversation, in which my uncle
and Conny joined with great readiness.</p>

<p>My uncle gained upon me. Yellow,
and spare, and shrewd as his face was, a
great deal of heart and amiability were
mixed up in it. He was five years
younger than my father, but was one of
those men who look fifty when they are
thirty, and forty when they are sixty.
He had lank black hair, and a long nose,
and a spasmodic way of speaking, as if,
after delivering himself of a few sentences,
he found difficulty in breathing.</p>

<p>I asked him what time the bank closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;At four,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;The clerks
generally get away by half-past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like the idea of being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
banker&#8217;s clerk?&#8221; inquired Conny, with a
gleam of mischief in her blue unfathomable
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least notion,&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;All that I know about banks is that
they are places where you offer cheques
and receive money for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said my uncle, with a laugh;
&#8220;but people must work very hard in order
to induce the banks to change those cheques
into money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder your papa didn&#8217;t put you
into the army,&#8221; said Conny. &#8220;Would not
you have liked to be a soldier?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is immaterial to me what I am,
provided I am easy in my mind, and
have time now and then to smoke a
cigar,&#8221; answered I, with the lofty languor
of an exquisite of the first water.</p>

<p>Conny laughed merrily; but, being afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
that my answer was a rather ungracious
one, all things considered, I changed the
subject by asking my uncle if he smoked.
Yes, he did smoke, incessantly, Mrs. Hargrave
told me; which meant that he had
a cigar after dinner and a cigar with his
grog before going to bed. I should have
probably pointed out that my uncle was
extraordinarily moderate in his consumption
of tobacco, and have proceeded to
give a sketch of our club in the Rue des
Chiens, and the immense quantity of <i>tabac
fin</i> and cigars that were smoked there at
a sitting, had not dinner been announced.
I gave my arm to my aunt, and, followed
by Conny and her papa, marched into the
dining-room, a charming apartment with a
large window conducting on to the lawn,
and glass doors leading into the conservatory,
the walls hung with good paintings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and the whole of the furniture in happy
taste. The setting sun was shining in
front, and filled the room with long slanting
rules of pink light, the effect of which
was to make Conny, who took a seat
fronting me, bewitchingly pretty. I had
tasted no food since eight o&#8217;clock that
morning, and therefore did abundant justice
to the very good dinner that had been
provided for me. My uncle was a capital
host. He allowed me to eat instead of disturbing
me with remarks, and damaging
my appetite by obliging me to talk.
His wines were capital; his cook,
like Bayard, <i>sans reproche</i>; I said to
him, holding up a glass of Madeira, &#8220;My
father would appreciate this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;why doesn&#8217;t he
come and see us? I should find him
aged, no doubt; but he was always a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
handsome man.&#8221; And he began to tell
us stories of his and his brother&#8217;s young
days, and how a certain young lady
broke her heart when my father went to
India, and how another young lady turned
Roman Catholic, and faded into a white
veil, when my father married. I thought
Conny looked sentimental whilst she listened.
I caught her eye once, during
these startling revelations, but saw that
she was not thinking of me by her
abstracted air.</p>

<p>By the time the sweets were on the
table, I was qualified for any amount of
conversation. I talked of Longueville,
and of the Emperor&#8217;s bow to my father,
the major, described the Empress and
her style, as well as I could, her fine
taste and sweet face, and graceful
manners&mdash;indeed, I talked so much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the imperial pair, whom I had only seen
once or twice at Longueville, that my
aunt got the extraordinary impression in
her head that I was an intimate friend of
theirs, as I afterwards learned, by her
boasting to a friend that, &#8220;Charlie was
often with the Emperor and Empress of
the French at Longueville.&#8221; True to my
resolution to deal with life as splendidly
as I could, and not a little excited into
a disposition to dazzle by Conny&#8217;s intoxicating
eyes, I talked of some titled
acquaintances of mine at Longueville,
and, I believe, dove-tailed their valuable
names into my remarks, with surprising
effect. I spoke of the capital cigars
Lord Towers used to give me; of the
gambling propensities of the Honourable
Mr. Spadille, Lord Shallowman&#8217;s brother,
who tried to induce the members of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
club to play for guinea points; of the
Marchioness of Cliffeton&#8217;s little suppers in
the Rue de Ville, &amp;c., &amp;c. Do you think
I told them that Lord Towers skulked in
Longueville, because he durst not show his
face in London for fear of Mr. Sloman?
That the Honourable Mr. Spadille,
Lord Shallowman&#8217;s brother, had bolted
from Leamington with Colonel Corney&#8217;s
wife? That the Countess of Cliffeton&mdash;bah!
What&#8217;s in a name? sometimes
a blackguard. What&#8217;s in a
lion&#8217;s skin? very often an ass. The
characters of certain of the English
nobility residing in Longueville were
nothing to nobody. All that <i>I</i> wanted
was, that my uncle, and aunt, and Conny
of the celestial eyes, should understand
that a young gentleman, named Charles
Hargrave, who, out of respect for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
father, the major, and out of regard for
his own prospects, had condescended to
become a banker&#8217;s clerk, had frequently
waltzed with a marchioness, and pledged
her at her own table in unpaid champagne,
had invariably addressed an English baron
by a convivial nickname, and had very
often helped to put the intoxicated
brother of a North British nobleman to
bed.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if my uncle was impressed;
but my aunt was, and I rather
think Conny was, too. An irresistible
thrill of pride ran through me, when my
aunt, leaning across the table, said with
great earnestness,</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, Mr. Charles, you will
despise the position Thomas has offered
you; but though the profession of banking
has sunk rather low since our day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
there are still plenty of gentlemen
engaged in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no sneer in this; I should
have instantly felt it had there been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Banking may have sunk low in other
places,&#8221; said Conny, with a heightened
colour, &#8220;but I am sure papa&#8217;s clerks are
gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure,&#8221; replied my aunt,
who every moment was proving herself
to be a deliciously candid woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Curling&#8217;s a gentleman,&#8221; said my
uncle, &#8220;and so is Spratling, though his
name might be grander.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Curling is gentlemanly, I admit,
but I don&#8217;t consider him to be a gentleman,&#8221;
exclaimed my aunt.</p>

<p>Conny picked at a bit of bread and
twisted the fragments into little balls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am sure I shall like banking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Mrs. Hargrave,&#8221; said I, with fine condescension.
&#8220;Of course,&#8221; I continued,
waving my hand in imitation of my
father, who would gesticulate in that
manner in a very impressive and polished
way: &#8220;if I had an income of my own,
however small, I should have preferred
to continue as I was. But necessity is
one of those things to which noblemen
as well as ploughmen must submit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said my uncle with a nod.
&#8220;Help yourself to more wine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought,&#8221; observed my
candid aunt with a face full of sober
honesty, and in a tone that quite forbade
all notion that any irony was intended,
&#8220;that you would have been able to marry
very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh! give him time&mdash;give him
time!&#8221; chuckled my uncle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>&#8220;I have never been in love,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Conny&#8217;s deep eyes, full of mournfulness,
met mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a great horror, Mrs. Hargrave,&#8221;
I went on, &#8220;of men who marry only for
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so have I,&#8221; said Conny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? you?&#8221; cried her papa, fondly.
&#8220;What do you know of these
matters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money,&#8221; I observed&mdash;a sucking Daniel
come to judgment!&mdash;&#8220;is no doubt very
necessary; but I never will admit that it
can be the foundation of married happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody at that table had said that it
was; and the observation was therefore
uncalled for. But I used to be a lover
of slashing commonplaces.</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite agree with you,&#8221; said Conny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
looking, as she spoke, a thorough child of
sensibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t love and money be sometimes
combined?&#8221; suggested my aunt deferentially,
as if henceforth and for ever she
never meant to be sure of anything until
I had given judgment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it,&#8221; I replied, and I gave her
my reasons: firstly, because, if the woman
had money, she would always be suspicious
of the man&#8217;s sincerity; and secondly&mdash;but
why print myself an ass? I spoke
much indescribable folly; though, let me
tell you, I never saw anybody look more
pleased than Conny as she listened to me.
She and I, and my aunt, had now all the
conversation to ourselves; for my uncle,
after having assured me that he was deaf
with dyspepsia, had become silent, and did
nothing but make faces and sip a <i>petit
goÃ»t</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> of brandy. There could be no
question that I had succeeded in
making a very good impression on my
aunt, and I rather fancied that Conny
seemed well pleased with me. I was
gentlemanly in my manners&mdash;I must
really be permitted to say that; and I
was not bad looking&mdash;which is an observation
I should not dream of making did
I not think it due to the public; and I
possessed the art, in some degree of perfection,
of talking a large amount of froth,
in a manner that ladies, in those days,
were obliging enough to think very agreeable
and diverting. Putting these facts
together, it is not very surprising that
my aunt, whom I treated with all imaginable
courtesy, should have been favourably
prejudiced; and I need not say,
therefore, that I was <i>not</i> very greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
astonished when she said to me, before
she left the table,</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish, Mr. Charles, that you
would change your mind, and make this
house your home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am deeply sensible of the kindness
and value of your offer, Mrs. Hargrave,&#8221;
I replied, with a bow my father might
have envied, &#8220;but I cannot think that
I should have any right to inflict my
presence upon you until you know me
better. My habits,&#8221; I continued, magnificently,
&#8220;have been formed in a school
that might clash with the prejudices of
English provincial life; for our philosophy
at Longueville is of the <i>laissez-aller</i> sort;
we are there, indeed, a species of lotus-eaters,
whose hardest physical work is
limited to dealing cards, and whose
hardest mental work consists in playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
them. When I have become more Anglicised,
I may then, with your hospitable
permission, accept your very great kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>She appeared overpowered by this speech,
and felt, I daresay, very much as though
she had just kissed hands at the Tuileries.
I glanced at Conny, who, catching my
eye, said saucily,</p>

<p>&#8220;All men like their freedom; but what
a freedom it is! it is a horrid slavery to
tobacco, late hours, and to everything bad
for the health.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was an opportunity for saying
something singularly neat and smart; but
I missed it from sheer want of wit.</p>

<p>The ladies now left the table. The
sun had sunk behind the hills, but many
gorgeous tints lingered behind, and made
the quiet sky beautiful. My uncle, lifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
his head out of his cravat, fixed a dyspeptic
eye upon me, and bade me draw
my chair near his and fill my glass. I
cannot express how much I liked the
honest, homely amiability of his manner.
He seemed to me the very essence of
kindness. We had a long chat about my
father, of whom he was very proud and
fond, and asked me many questions about
his habits and opinions and means. He
then talked of my other uncle, Richard,
and his daughter Theresa, whom he
described as a very fine girl, but so
eccentric in her conduct as to cause some
uneasiness to her father, who was anxious
to get her married.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she is handsome and has money,&#8221;
I observed, &#8220;surely a husband ought to
be easily got for her.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dick tells me she has had several
admirers,&#8221; answered my uncle, &#8220;but she is
so confoundedly fastidious that nobody is
able to please her. What do you think
of Conny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a cousin to boast of. She is
the prettiest girl I have ever seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>My uncle looked immensely gratified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said he with a broad smile.
&#8220;She is pretty enough. I have nothing
to complain of. An only child is not
always so well favoured. When nature is
mean, she is generally mean with a vengeance.
But Conny is a sly puss; she
has made her mamma and me a little
uneasy latterly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My cashier, Curling, is a rather good
looking young fellow, and Mrs. Hargrave
has got an idea in her head that Conny
admires him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, there is no harm in that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is afraid that Conny likes him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Women often have the queerest tastes,&#8221;
said I uneasily. Why was I irritated by
my aunt&#8217;s suspicion?</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice that my wife rather
poo-pooh&#8217;d bankers&#8217; clerks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was done for a motive,&#8221; said
my uncle with a twinkling eye. &#8220;My
wife is a shrewd woman. I have no
right to be her trumpeter, but I must
say that very few women have my wife&#8217;s
sagacity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Curling a gentleman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so. He is a London man.
But he&#8217;s no match for my daughter, I
can tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think not,&#8221; said I jealously
and warmly; &#8220;very few men are.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>&#8220;However,&#8221; continued my uncle, twisting
a wine-glass round upon the table,
&#8220;all this may be a mere delusion on the
part of your aunt.&#8221; [<i>Your aunt!</i> Do
you mark the flattering identification?]
&#8220;It would certainly never do to appear
suspicious. Trifles are easily made significant
and important. Curling used to be
asked here sometimes, but my wife won&#8217;t
have him now; and I think she&#8217;s right.
Eh? What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>I fully agreed with him; and we then
rose to join the ladies.</p>

<p>Whilst we talked I had heard the sound
of a piano, and on entering the drawing-room
found Conny alone, playing very
prettily. She instantly jumped up when
she saw her father and me. I begged
her to keep her place, but she refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you play?&#8221; she asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>&#8220;A waltz or two,&#8221; said I; &#8220;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little haughty command was delightful.
I went at once and dashed into a
piece of dance-music; then looked up,
thinking it was Conny who stood near,
but found it was my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a charming touch, Mr.
Charles,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Of course you sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course I didn&#8217;t. She wouldn&#8217;t believe
me, so conquering and clever did she
consider her nephew. I dropped my assurances
to the contrary after a little, being
perfectly satisfied to be included in the
rank of those who have honour thrust
upon them, and went up to Conny and
asked her to play.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would much rather smoke a cigar
with papa than listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I grow eloquent,&#8221; said I, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
a smile, &#8220;I should like to know if I may
call you Constance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I believe cousins are privileged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And after I have called you Constance
a few times, just for form&#8217;s sake, may I
address you as Conny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call me what you please,&#8221; she replied,
with the loveliest flush of pink in her
fair cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said I, &#8220;Constance, so far
from wishing to smoke, I would be perfectly
content to give up that habit for
ever, if you would but consent to play
the piano to me, every time a longing
came across me for a cigar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a little story,&#8221; she said in a
whisper.</p>

<p>Oh! what lovely eyes! oh, what glorious
hair! Come, Pauline, come quickly, and
snatch me from this peril! Or, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Pauline has grown too fat to come
quickly, rise ye recollections of defeat and
humiliation, of rage and despair, and steel
my heart against the bewildering memories
that make it languish as I write.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is solemn truth,&#8221; said I. Whereupon
she went to the piano, and played
&#8220;Il segrÃ©to per esse felice,&#8221; whilst mamma
kept time with her head, and papa
warbled an accompaniment at the other
end of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if it is too cold to smoke a
cigar out of doors,&#8221; said my uncle, opening
one of the windows and thrusting his
hand out to test the temperature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, much too cold, I am sure.
Why can&#8217;t you and Mr. Charles smoke
in the library? We&#8217;ll keep you company,&#8221;
observed my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; answered my uncle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
&#8220;Charlie, I hope you won&#8217;t mind the
ladies joining us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mind! oh irony, where is thy sting?
And this was a house I durst not live in,
for fear I shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to have
my liberty! This was a house where
smoking was forbidden! Where &#8220;Emma&#8221;
and &#8220;C&#339;lebs&#8221; were read aloud, whilst
Miss tatted! Where lights were put out
at a quarter before ten! Dolt! numskull!
but it was too late: my honour was involved;
my dignity was at stake! my
importance must not be tarnished. I had
said I would go into lodgings, and there
was an end.</p>

<p>We all repaired to the library, where
my aunt lighted some candles, and where
my uncle produced a box of cigars, whilst
Conny struck a wax match, and shaded
the flame with her hand (whereby the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
light shone in her eyes, and made her
hair sparkle like the sea at night), ready
to hold to my cigar when I wanted
it. I asked Mrs. Hargrave if she didn&#8217;t
object to the smell of tobacco. Oh no;
she liked it. She owned that she didn&#8217;t
much care about pipes, but she knew
no smell so fragrant as that of a good
cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think my brother the major
would enjoy this?&#8221; said my uncle, lying
back in a capacious arm-chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be his ideal of happiness,&#8221;
I answered.</p>

<p>And I believed it would. The room,
though large, was wonderfully snug, furnished
with book-cases filled with volumes,
and the walls ornamented with rich old
engravings. My aunt sat near the table
sewing, but not busily; and Conny occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a chair near her papa, with her
hands folded on her lap, doing nothing.
What could be more homely than such a
scene? Oh, ladies, do you not know that
your presence makes the cigar doubly
soothing and fragrant, and choice beyond
the wildest advertising dreams of the
tobacconist? There are men&mdash;call them
Ogres, Bluebeards, Turks, Ashantees&mdash;who
profess to think that the one great
charm of tobacco is, that it gives them
an excuse to get away from your society.
But take the word of a man who loves,
admires, reverences your sex with the
ardour of a Frenchman and the loyalty of
a Briton&mdash;that to all good men Havannah
fumes never taste so sweet as when your
white hands present the lighted spill,
and when your fair presences are enthroned
in the ambrosial cloud. No, madam, don&#8217;t&mdash;pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
don&#8217;t pretend that good tobacco-smoke
is objectionable. I speak not of
mundungus, of the poisonous negro-head,
of the raw, coarse cavendish. These, I
admit, discharge fumes fit only for hothouses.
I have in my mind the dry, the
nutty, the aromatic cigar, to which, give
me leave to ask, did ever an engaged
woman object? Fie! you liked it, Julia,
when James was courting you. Didn&#8217;t
you give him a silver match-box? It is
wifely tyranny, I say, that drives him and
his <i>intimidads</i> into a back-room; it is
caprice that kecks at his comforts, not at
his cigars. Go! thou art not my wife.
I would not own thee. The true, the
faithful, the fond, sits at her husband&#8217;s
feet, whilst he exhales the blue smoke in
rings to the ceiling. I call a blessing on
her. May her sons be honest men, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
may they never know the want of a good
cigar!</p>

<p>It was eight o&#8217;clock, when my uncle
suddenly sitting bolt upright, said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hurry you, Charlie;
but as you have a two miles&#8217; drive before
you, and as I believe your landlady has
been expecting you since eight o&#8217;clock this
morning, what say if I order the phaeton
to be got ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>I assented with a stoical face, but with
an inward deep reluctance. What a fool
I was to permit my ridiculous fears to prevent
me living at Grove End! My uncle
rung the bell, and ordered the trap,
whilst my aunt expressed her regrets that
it was necessary for me to leave so
early, and her hopes that I would find
my lodgings comfortable.</p>

<p>I caught Conny smiling once or twice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and when, at last, meeting her blue eyes
full, I said, &#8220;Something amuses my
cousin;&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I know why
you wouldn&#8217;t live here&mdash;you were afraid
you would not be able to smoke.&#8221; It
would not do to admit such an impeachment
as this; I must either deal with
the matter splendidly, or say nothing.
So I assured Conny, in my loftiest
manner, that she was quite in error; that
I never for a moment doubted that I
should be received and treated&mdash;as I
had been&mdash;with delightful kindness; that
my reason for declining her papa&#8217;s and
mamma&#8217;s offer, was my disinclination to
burden their home with the presence of
a bachelor, whose ways and habits&mdash;here
I repeated what I had before said
to my aunt; taking care, however, to
exhibit those &#8220;ways and habits,&#8221; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
which I alluded in a light that could
not fail to make them imposing and
lordly, and precisely such characteristics
as would naturally belong to a young
gentleman who had mingled all his life
in the society of men of high birth and
distinguished positions.</p>

<p>My uncle wanted to accompany me to
my lodgings, and &#8220;see me comfortable
for the night,&#8221; as he said; and my aunt
encouraged him to do so. But I was
firm&mdash;I said no. I would not hear of
his leaving the house to be my companion
in a long drive through the
night-air. I had my way; and my portmanteau
being hoisted into the phaeton,
I followed it amid a chorus of good-nights,
and hopes that I would sleep
well.</p>

<p>The road to Updown was pretty hilly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
but smooth and good: and, in a very
short time, the little mare had rattled
us into the High Street. James had his
directions, and presently pulled up before
a detached house, in which, he informed
me, were my lodgings. I pushed open
the garden gate and knocked at the door.
After a pretty long interval, a key was
turned, a chain unslipped, a bolt withdrawn,
and an elderly woman, with a
candle over her head, stood forth. I told
her who I was; whereupon she dropped
me a curtsey, and said she had quite
given me up for that day. James
brought in my portmanteau, and went
away, thanking me for a little trifle I
gave him. The elderly woman then conducted
me into a good-sized parlour,
which she said was my sitting-room, very
comfortably furnished, with a good large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
sofa in it, that took my fancy mightily.
She then led me to my bed-room, and
this apartment I also found unexceptionable
in all points. She asked me if I
would take tea, and on my saying yes,
she went away to prepare it, whilst I
unpacked my portmanteau. When I returned
to the parlour, I found it cheerful
and brilliant, with a fine old-fashioned oil
lamp; the tea-things were on the table,
and the pretty crockery made me feel as
much at home as if I had lodged with
Mrs. Reeves a year.</p>

<p>So far everything that had befallen me
was entirely to my taste. My uncle&#8217;s reception
of me had been overpowering; my
aunt, it was plain, thought me a very fine
and splendid person; my cousin was pretty
enough to make Updown a paradise; and
nothing could be more comfortable than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
my lodgings. After tea I lighted a pipe
and stretched myself along the sofa and
thought over matters. It was, perhaps,
all for the best that I had decided not
to live at Grove End. I could keep up
my dignity better by residing at a distance.
No doubt I should be asked there
as often as I cared to be; and I should
certainly enjoy my kind-hearted relations&#8217;
hospitality not the less because I could
combine my privileges with personal independence.</p>

<p>Conny ran in my head a good deal.
What a little pet she was! I could love
that girl, I thought. Who was Curling?
Did she like him? He must be a very
impertinent sort of fellow to think about
her. I supposed that he had paid her
attention, and as perhaps he was not
entirely ugly, and as young men didn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
abound in these parts, she had talked
a little nonsense about him to her
mamma, which had frightened the old
lady. Pshaw! thought I, what chance
would Curling stand against me if I took
it into my head to unseat him? What!
a banker&#8217;s clerk, a man of pass-books
and cancelled cheques against a gentleman
who knew nothing of business,
who thought money an insufferable bore,
and credit the easiest and most courtly
way of supplying one&#8217;s needs; who was
a man of the world, a great favourite
with women, a good billiard player, and
the friend, the intimate friend, of men
who, were it not for their tailors
and hatters, would be making brilliant
with their presence and wit the high
society from which the heartless dun
or the yet more inexorable bailiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
had obliged them to beat a precipitate
retreat.</p>

<p>I laughed at the absurdity of the idea.
Why, in all probability, Conny was already
in love with me. Of course they were
talking about me at Grove End. Couldn&#8217;t
I hear my uncle exclaim, with pardonable
exultation, &#8220;<i>My</i> nephew!&#8221; which meant,
&#8220;See, my dears, what <i>our</i> side has produced!&#8221;
And what could my aunt do
but praise me and abuse Curling, and
contrast my manners with the cashier&#8217;s
(Oh, humiliating comparison!), and wonder,
with a sneer, whether Louis Napoleon
would have pulled off his hat to Curling&#8217;s
papa?</p>

<p><i>Risum teneatis, amici?</i> asks Maunder&#8217;s
Treasury of Knowledge. I was Mr. Bottom,
of the ass&#8217;s ears, in those days. Behold
my magnanimity! I pull my ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
character out of obscurity, as I would an
old coat to dress a scarecrow withal, that
it may be a warning and a horror to men.
Only please don&#8217;t confound the high-minded
being who addresses you with the
senseless, conceited dummy that idly flaps
his useless arms about the fields.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> breakfasted by nine the next morning,
and after a conversation with my
landlady respecting matters of much too
mean a nature to figure in this fastidious
narrative, I filled my pipe, put on my
hat, and went out.</p>

<p>The morning was lovely; I never drew
breath with a keener enjoyment of life;
the garden in front of Mrs. Reeves&#8217; house
was small, but plentifully stocked; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
wall-flowers made the air delicious, and I
could have very well passed a whole hour
standing at the gate smoking my pipe,
and watching the quiet interests with
which the long street was peopled.</p>

<p>Whilst I lingered, debating which way
I should go, I beheld a smart vehicle
approaching, and recognised my uncle&#8217;s
phaeton. He was in it, and waved his
hand to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up already!&#8221; he cried, springing
briskly into the road. &#8220;Conny has lost
a pair of gloves. She bet me that I
should find you in bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She deserves to lose,&#8221; said I, laughing,
&#8220;for having such a bad opinion of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you sleep? Did you like
your rooms? Is Mrs. Reeves obliging?
Is your bed comfortable?&#8221; were some
among the many questions my uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
asked me in his cheery, cordial manner;
and hearing that I was perfectly satisfied
and happy, he asked me what I meant
to do? I told him that I was about to
take a walk and see the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, first, and let me show you the
bank. We open at half-past nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>I put my pipe in my pocket, and
scrambled up into the back seat, and
away we clattered down the High Street,
through the ancient gateway, and round
the corner, stopping before a new building
over which the word &#8220;Bank&#8221; was engraved.
My uncle led the way in. The
office was clean and new, and made
fearfully business-like by a counter and
high stools and advertisement-charts of
insurance offices. A young man stepped
from behind a ground-glass front, and my
uncle introduced him to me as Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Curling. I bowed loftily, and fixed a
scrutinising eye upon the young gentleman.
He was more cordial, and offered
me his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to know you, Mr. Hargrave,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much obliged to you,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yonder is Mr. Spratling,&#8221; said my
uncle, smiling at the youth who had
turned his head on hearing his name pronounced.
I nodded, and Mr. Spratling
stared. My uncle then went round the
counter, calling to me to follow, and
going up to a desk behind the ground-glass
front, said, &#8220;This will be your
place, Charlie,&#8221; and watched my face;
but I said nothing, though I <i>could</i> have
commented in very forcible terms upon
the immense inconvenience it would be
to me&mdash;a lounger born&mdash;of having to sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
on a high stool all day and write down
dry bucolic names and rows of figures in
a huge book called a ledger. My uncle
then conducted me into his private office
at the back, and leaning against the
table, asked me, with a rather humorous
twinkle in his eye, &#8220;How my look-out
struck me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what,&#8221; I answered, seating
myself, for it was always my opinion that
you can&#8217;t make a greater mistake than to
stand when you can sit; &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you
what, uncle; you are such a thoroughly
good fellow, with so nice a sense of what
is due to a gentleman, that I believe,
after a little, I shall be able to endure
this life. But in any other office than
yours, with any other man but you
over me, I could no more submit to
have a counter placed between me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
society, than I could submit to cleaning
boots.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed heartily, and clapping me
on the shoulder, exclaimed,</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean you to be a clerk; all
that I want you to do is to learn the
business. I have plans for you, which
both you and your father will like, I
believe. But you <i>must</i> learn the business.
I don&#8217;t mean you to do any dry or mean
work, such as collecting bills. Look over
young Spratling&#8217;s shoulder now and then,
and observe what he is about. Pump Mr.
Curling&mdash;he is good-natured and a smart
hand&mdash;and get all the information you can
out of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I will, with pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t fear any ill-feeling. They
know you are my nephew, and I have
told them that your father has sent you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to me to learn business habits, and to
qualify you for becoming&mdash;well, I shall
have more to say to you about the future
before long. I have a good scheme in
my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are all kindness,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;Every moment I am with you makes
me think of Longueville with less regret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he exclaimed, looking immensely
gratified and amiable. &#8220;And
now, as I told you last night, I don&#8217;t
want you to formally join us until Monday.
You are under an engagement to my wife&mdash;who,
I can assure you, has fallen in
love with you!&mdash;to dine with us every
day&mdash;that is, if you like; and she takes
you under her protection until Monday
morning, when she will consign you to
me. She has ordered the carriage at
eleven, and means, I believe, to take you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
a drive round the town, and show you
what there is to be seen. The phaeton
will convey you to Grove End.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Spratling came in, and said
Mr. Clover wanted an audience. I took
my hat, but before I went out, my uncle
called me back to whisper, &#8220;You&#8217;ll find
a box of cigars in the library,&#8221; and dismissed
me with a cheerful push. Mr.
Curling bowed as I passed out, and I
returned his salute politely. I felt more
at my ease now that my uncle had told
me that these young men were to regard
me as a gentleman who had condescended
to join the bank merely for the purpose
of acquiring business habits. I cannot
say that I thought Mr. Curling good-looking.
His eyes indeed were not bad;
but he didn&#8217;t look a manly sort of
fellow. He was narrow and thin-breasted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and had curly black hair, which I detest.
His teeth were good, and his smile so-so,
but his dress was <i>outrÃ©</i>, ill-fitting, and
he wore a ring on the first finger of his
right hand&mdash;the hand he wrote with, the
finger he pointed with&mdash;which affected
me more disagreeably than had he said
&#8220;You was,&#8221; and dropped his h&#8217;s and g&#8217;s.
It was ridiculous to suppose that golden-haired
Conny could see anything in such
a man as that. As to Spratling, he
looked a harmless little fellow; his head
and hands were immense, and his shoulders
broad enough for a man of my father&#8217;s
height; yet he might have walked under
my arm.</p>

<p>I cocked my hat as I strolled past the
counter with a slow and indolent step;
and stopped, when on the pavement,
full in the sight of Mr. Curling, to light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
a cigar, though I should have preferred
a pipe. I then got into the phaeton,
and was driven to Grove End.</p>

<p>My aunt received me in the most
gracious manner. The first question she
asked me was, if I had breakfasted: and,
on my replying in the affirmative,
eagerly questioned me about my lodgings.
Was I quite sure I was comfortable,
she wanted to know; because, if I was not,
there was a delightful bed-room, entirely
at my service, at the back of the house,
and she would give orders at once for it
to be got ready. I hope I showed her
that my gratitude was equal to her
kindness. Indeed I was almost embarrassed
by the extraordinary civilities I
had met with; and, though I believe
there was not another man in England,
at that time, who had a better opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
of himself than I had, yet I must do
myself the justice to declare that I did
not conscientiously believe I deserved
the kindness I received.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened and in came
Conny. She gave me her hand, which I
raised to my lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a German fashion,&#8221; said I,
rather dismayed by her extravagant
blush.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; she answered, turning her
head aside and looking half angry and
half pleased. &#8220;I thought it wasn&#8217;t
English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The French kiss each other on both
cheeks, don&#8217;t they?&#8221; inquired my aunt
with naÃ¯ve interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men do, and I also believe it is
customary among lovers. But I fancy
that the custom does not prevail amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the married folks, from the story that is
told of a Frenchman, who, hearing that
a friend of his had kissed his wife, cried
&#8216;<i>Quoi! sans y etre obligÃ©!</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>You see, I meant to mingle sarcasm
with humour, and to shine as a wit; but
to crack a joke with my aunt was like
pulling a cracker at a supper-table with
your partner, who gets only a piece of
the paper, and leaves the sweetmeat and
the motto with you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said she. &#8220;Now I should
have thought such a custom would have
been entirely confined to the married
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at Conny. How was she
dressed? Now you want to puzzle me.
Was it black silk? I believe it was.
Whatever the material, it was dark
enough to set off the transporting whiteness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of her throat, and to make the curl
that gleamed down her back shine (to use
the language of an imitator of Ossian)
like the lustrous wake of a meteor upon
the midnight sky. What pearly teeth!
What a surprisingly dainty complexion!
Where did this girl learn to dress her
hair? Never did I see hair so becomingly
dressed. Is she to be my heroine?
<i>Nous verrons</i>; but I rather fear, if she
is to be my heroine, that hair of hers
won&#8217;t serve any dramatic exigencies. How
<i>could</i> it flow, as all heroines&#8217; gold-coloured
hair ought to flow, at an instant&#8217;s notice,
in a bright cloud over a pillar of a man&#8217;s
throat, if it is dressed so well and firmly?
All we dare hope is that we shall meet
with no pillars (columns I think they call
them) for Conny&#8217;s hair to flow over. But
if a column or a pillar of a throat <i>will</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
interfere, in spite of our earnest remonstrances,
let us at least trust that the
hair-pins will do their duty, and maintain
the respectability of passion by holding
the pads and puffs and frizettes in their
proper places.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said I, following her to
the window, &#8220;that my foreign manners
haven&#8217;t ruined me in your good opinion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you last night that cousins are
privileged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They ought to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going for a drive with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mamma ordered the carriage expressly
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned to mamma, who sat smiling
at us, behind our backs, and thanked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you would like to see the
town, Mr. Charles.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>&#8220;Pray call me Charlie,&#8221; said I, &#8220;or
your example will give Conny an excuse
to treat me with reserve. You see how
familiarly I name her. But I got her
leave to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, cousins ought always to be on
the very best terms! Aren&#8217;t they made
of the same flesh and blood?&#8221; said my
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they are,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conny,&#8221; said her mamma, &#8220;will you
go and get ready for the drive, so that
you can show Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, I mean Charlie,
over the grounds, while I put on my
things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Conny, and went out.</p>

<p>My aunt chatted about a variety of
commonplaces; and my sense of self-complacency,
which, God knows, was
already impertinent enough, was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
little heightened by the marked deference
and laboured urbanity of her manner to
me. Had I been a prince of the blood
royal, I don&#8217;t think she could have
shown herself more flattered by my conversation,
and more obliged by my condescension.
There could be no doubt
that her husband had inspired her with
the most extravagant conceptions of the
importance and splendour of his brother,
the major. The pride of relationship,
when there is anything to be proud of,
is a sentiment, Eugenio, which springs
eternal in all human breasts; it enables
wives to snub their husbands with applause,
and husbands to humiliate their
wives with impunity; it gives importance
to poverty and dignity to vulgarity;
it embroiders the rags of the
beggar, and justifies the impertinencies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
unresisting imbecility. No, Eugenio, I
am not quoting from &#8220;Rasselas.&#8221; This
is all my own thunder.</p>

<p>When Conny came in my aunt left the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray forgive me,&#8221; said I, &#8220;but, really,
that is a lovely little hat you have on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you like it,&#8221; answered my
cousin, looking at herself in the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;All feminine attire is becoming that
looks saucy. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this hat saucy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very. There is a knowing expression
about the feather, as though it has just
been pulled out of a peacock&#8217;s tail, and
the eye hasn&#8217;t had time to stop winking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an odd idea! but this isn&#8217;t a
peacock&#8217;s feather!&#8221;</p>

<p>What! was <i>she</i> going to prove as literal
as her mamma? Defend it, ye Nine!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>&#8220;And then,&#8221; I went on, &#8220;there is an
audacity about the curve of the brim,
that fills me with irrepressible delight.
Let me assure you, dear cousin, that it
is the very hat of all the hats that ever
were made, which you ought to wear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my choice,&#8221; said she, looking
at me as though she were a little afraid.
&#8220;But the carriage will soon be ready,
and mamma wanted me to show you over
the grounds before we drove out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would much rather sit here with
you,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;I can look at the
grounds this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; said she prettily, seating
herself in her mamma&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>She fronted the window, in consequence
the light was full upon her face, and I
was able to see every expression that rose
and faded in it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>&#8220;Your father introduced me to the
bank this morning,&#8221; said I, fixing my
eye upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had the honour of making the
acquaintance of Mr. Curling.&#8221;</p>

<p>I expected to see her wince and change
colour. On the contrary, she remained
perfectly impassive. She did not even
ask me what I thought of him, or if I
liked him, or anything about him. All
she said was, &#8220;I hope you and he will
get on together. He seems a very nice
sort of young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Love prompts a thousand absurdities;
but never in all my experience of life
could I conceive a girl calling the object
of her affection &#8220;a nice young man.&#8221; The
phrase smote me as the death-knell of
Curling&#8217;s hopes, if he had any.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t very much care about nice
young men,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I have been
bred in a land of piquant sauces and
thickly peppered dishes, and like things
well flavoured. A nice person is a boiled
character which you have to discuss without
salt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you mean,&#8221; she exclaimed
gaily. &#8220;Mr. Meek, our doctor
here, is a boiled character, full of what
papa calls negative excellence, which
means thorough insipidity.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was much gratified to find her capable
of appreciating my jokes. It <i>did</i> seem
impossible that such demure, sweet, intelligent
eyes as hers should be the
windows of a sluggish, dull nature. I
was resolved to try her a little more on
the subject of the cashier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father gave me to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
that Mr. Curling was good-looking. How
people differ in their tastes? Now I
think Mr. Curling anything but good
looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very thin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very; one thing I noticed, the cockneyfication
of his person by a big
ring on his first finger. These fellows
ought to go abroad now and then.
&#8216;Home keeping youths have ever homely
wits.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you know what another
poet says?</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8216;What learn our youth abroad but to refine</div>
<div class="verse">The homely vices of their native land?</div>
<div class="verse">Give me an honest, home-spun country clown</div>
<div class="verse">Of our own growth; his dullness is but plain,</div>
<div class="verse">But their&#8217;s embroidered; they are sent out fools</div>
<div class="verse">But come back fops!&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;God bless me!&#8221; said I uncomfortably;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
&#8220;what a memory you have! Who wrote
that rubbish?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I forget. It was a school exercise,
and that is how I happen to know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you have no more pat quotations
at your finger ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. What other poetry I know is
all sentimental.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;I am very fond
of sentimental poetry&mdash;Moore&#8217;s for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder, with your refined taste,
that you could ever tolerate the notion
of settling into a banker&#8217;s clerk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was she ironical? Was she sarcastic?
Her eyes were all innocence; her face all
candour.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not the choice of my will, but
of my poverty. Nature made me a gentleman,
but forgot to endow me. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
there is nothing for me to do, but
to forget her good intentions and learn
book-keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here she looked at the clock, and as
she did so her mamma came rustling
and swelling in, decked out in a fine
bonnet, new gloves, and a stiff blue silk
gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you been to see the grounds,
Charlie?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been very well entertained,&#8221;
I replied with a smile at Conny.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the carriage!&#8221; exclaimed my
cousin, and a barouche with two horses,
driven by my friend James in silver
livery, swept along the avenue and
stopped at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have lost our footman,&#8221; said my
aunt, apologetically, as we passed out,
&#8220;but I hope to replace him next week.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
I begged her not to mention it; we got
in, and off we went.</p>

<p>I faced Conny, and was thus able to
alternate luxuriously between the beauties
of nature and the beauties of human
nature. When we reached Updown,
James was requested to drive slowly, in
order that I might &#8220;view&#8221; the town. It
turned out that my aunt was a native
of the place, and knew a good deal of
its history, social and otherwise. The
carriage was stopped at the huge gateway
at the bottom of the High Street,
that I might decipher the inscription, and
admire the carvings. Unfortunately the
inscription was in Latin, with v&#8217;s for u&#8217;s.
I did not understand it, but as I had
always been given to believe that a
knowledge of the dead tongues was
esteemed a very essential ingredient in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the composition of a gentleman&#8217;s character,
I looked wise, and talked much nonsense
about the unintelligibility of mediÃ¦val
Latin.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say,&#8221; observed my aunt, &#8220;that
this gate was built by the Romans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that must be a mistake,&#8221; I
answered, &#8220;for don&#8217;t you see the date
MDCLI?&#8221; which was the only part of
the inscription I could read.</p>

<p>&#8220;The writing says that the gateway
was restored in that year,&#8221; said Conny,
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! do you understand Latin?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Mr. Curling told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>My aunt tossed her head, and exclaimed,
&#8220;I am sure Mr. Curling can&#8217;t
read Latin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed he can!&#8221; returned Conny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
looking for an instant with her deep,
deep eyes, at her mamma, and then
letting them drop with a little smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;James, drive on!&#8221; cried Mrs. Hargrave.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Curling&#8217;s head been under
our wheels, I believe at that moment I
should have sat through the jump of
the carriage unmoved. Was my aunt&#8217;s
suspicion right? did Conny care about
that lean young man at the bank?
Suppose he <i>could</i> read Latin&mdash;what
then? I daresay he had bragged of this
solitary achievement to my cousin, and
she had mentioned it first to pique her
mother.</p>

<p>I looked at her, and then at my
aunt, and then pretended to fall into a
rapture over an old gable-peaked house
with latticed windows, and a porch surmounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
by an effigy of Time. The town
abounded in venerable structures of this
kind; but the builders were busy in the
suburbs, and the country outside was
dotted with little stucco residences, squares
of plaster, coloured like gingerbread&mdash;advertised
as charming homes for newly-married
couples&mdash;poor wretches! My
relations received several bows during
our progress through the streets, and&mdash;I
say this without vanity&mdash;I was a good
deal stared at. I know nothing more
ludicrous than bucolic curiosity. I was
incessantly laughing to see some old
man or woman turn slowly to look after
us, as if our carriage were a magnet, and
their noses were steel, and gaze until we
were out of sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do the people amuse themselves
all day long?&#8221; I asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>Conny had no idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are any balls or dinner-parties ever
given?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered my aunt, emphatically.
&#8220;Society here is very mean and close.
The only parties that are given are by
new-comers. But they soon find out that
it is a one-sided amusement, and drop it.
A call is all the return people think of
making.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Longueville,&#8221; said I, &#8220;we are
dancing all the year round. What with
<i>fÃªtes champÃªtres</i>, and balls at <i>l&#8217;Institution
de Bienfaisance</i>, and private parties, one
never has an evening to one&#8217;s self.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was stretching a small truth into
colossal dimensions; but as Dr. Primrose
says, &#8220;I was never much displeased with
those harmless delusions that tend to
make us more happy.&#8221; And it certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
made me happy to increase my importance
in my aunt&#8217;s and Conny&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>We got out of the town into the
country, and I was not sorry for the
change. My aunt had so much to say
about Updown, that I got bored with her
recollections before we reached the top of
High Street. Now carrots and corn-fields
have no social and historical associations;
and when we got among the trees, her
memory slackened, and enabled me to
talk with Conny.</p>

<p>Considering I had met her for the first
time in my life only on the afternoon of
the previous day, I don&#8217;t know what right
I had to possess an intense longing to
ask her if she was in love with Mr.
Curling. Her sentiments ought to have
been nothing to me. But they were.
Indeed, I discovered at this very early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
stage, that I took a profound interest in
them. I noticed one thing; my aunt
seemed thoroughly well pleased with the
attention I paid her daughter, and with
the unaffected admiration that overspread
my face when I looked at her. My conceit
made it a mere matter-of-course, that
both Mr. and Mrs. Hargrave would be
transported with joy, and rendered giddy
with emotions of pride, were I to give
them to understand that Conny was agreeable
to me, and that I would not mind
marrying her. But I was not so sure
that Conny herself would share in their
delirium. She rather puzzled me. Sometimes
I thought her shy and simple.
Sometimes she confounded me with a
sudden sally&mdash;a smart retort&mdash;a pat
allusion, apt, shrewd and well-timed enough
to reverse my judgment, and set me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
speculating on her real character. If she
meant me to fall in love with her, she
was going the right way to work. Pique
your man, Clorinda, before you angle
for him. The cleverest fishers among
you always summon the sentiments with
ground-bait before they throw the hook
in.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I look upon this as one of the fortunate days of
your life. It ends an epoch and begins one. Hitherto
the life-blood has been gradually chilling in your veins,
as you sat aloof within your circle of gentility, while
the rest of the world was fighting out its battle with
one kind of necessity or another. Henceforth you will
at least have the sense of natural and healthy effort
for a purpose, and of lending your strength&mdash;be it
great or small&mdash;to the united struggle of mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p class="right"><i>The House of the Seven Gables.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the rest of the week I was every
day at Grove End. I took long walks
with Conny and her mamma, drove with
them, wandered about the grounds, which
were tolerably extensive and well wooded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
smoked incessantly, listened to Conny
playing the piano, read the papers, wrote
to my father and to Lord Towers, whose
reply I was anxious that my relations
should see, and was, altogether, so perfectly
contented, that I should have
viewed my return to Longueville as a
calamity.</p>

<p>But where is the ointment without a
fly in it? Where is the feast without a
death&#8217;s head? I confess I regarded the
prospect of mounting the high stool I
had seen in the bank, and becoming the
friend and colleague of Mr. Spratling, of
the big head, and of Mr. Curling, of the
cockneyfied forefinger, with little satisfaction.
I felt myself much too fine a fellow
to do the work that Curling and Spratling
did. I had sometimes a hope that
my aunt would snatch me from my fate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
point out to her husband that my elegance
might be damaged by a collision with
coarse business details, and urge him
either to adopt me, or to invent some
graceful scheme for supplying me with
money. However, it was out of my
power to hint at such a measure; which
I then considered a very great misfortune.</p>

<p>I accompanied the family to church
on Sunday. It was enough that I should
be a stranger to get stared at. The congregation
was almost entirely composed of
old men and women&mdash;I don&#8217;t think I saw
one young man. I must except Mr.
Curling, who looked down upon us from
the gallery: and, perhaps I may have
indulged in a secret chuckle, when I
thought if he were really in love with
Conny, how mad he would be to see her
and me bending over the hymn-book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
together, and praying side by side. I
didn&#8217;t catch Conny looking at him once,
which put me into a very good
temper.</p>

<p>The rector dined with us that day: a
sober-faced, square-bodied man, who spoke
in measured accents, and wore a beard.
He professed to know Paris well, and
asked me, in French, if I had ever dined
at Philippe&#8217;s, in so vile an accent, that I
could scarcely answer him for fear of
bursting into a laugh. I observed by
my aunt&#8217;s and uncle&#8217;s treatment of him,
that they thought him a very considerable
person; by which they paid me no
compliment; for of what worth is the
admiration that can fasten itself upon a
being who has nothing in the wide world
to recommend him, &#8220;but his calling?&#8221;
Set a thief to catch a thief! In a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
short time I found out that he was a
boaster, and one egregious slip put him
completely at my mercy. But I spared
him: my idea being that every gentleman
is bound to consider clergymen and
women as being under his particular
protection.</p>

<p>I awoke next morning thoroughly out
of conceit with myself. My uncle had
asked me to be at the bank at half-past
nine; and, whilst I shaved, I reflected,
with much bitterness, upon the indignity
to which necessity obliged me to submit.
Had anybody asked me which I would
rather be, a groom or a banker&#8217;s clerk,
I should have answered, a groom. Distressed
noblemen had driven coaches,
and hungry baronets had, before now,
curried horses for hire. But a banker&#8217;s
clerk&mdash;faugh! Lady Cliffeton would cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
me dead were she to be told of it, I
thought: and, in imagination, I could
hear Lord Towers in the finical, mincing
accent I had so often fruitlessly attempted
to get, denying that he had ever known
me.</p>

<p>However, in spite of my distress, I was
punctual, and got to the bank before my
uncle. Mr. Curling stretched his hand
across for me to shake, and asked me
to step round. I eyed the counter with
abhorrence, walked haughtily around it,
and having gained the other side, felt
that I had raised between me and society
an obstacle which nothing short of a
change of name would enable me to surmount.
Mr. Spratling, bowing his head
over his big ledger, scribbled furiously,
and took no notice of me. I asked Mr.
Curling if smoking was allowed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
premises. He replied, with much diffidence,
&#8220;I think not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is my work to be?&#8221; I enquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;From what Mr. Hargrave said,&#8221; he
replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you will be required
to do anything. However, I
presume you are here to learn the
business; and if I can be of any use to
you, I shall be only too glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thanked him, and replied that it was
my wish to learn the business, and to do
my share of the work. I couldn&#8217;t say
less.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is very little to be done,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;Our customers are a very
quiet set. Most of our accounts are
deposits; and our discount business is by
no means large. Market days are our
heaviest time. The farmers then pay in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you call deposit accounts?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>&#8220;Accounts that are left in our hands
not to be drawn upon without notice.
We allow interest on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is interest?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Spratling uttered a faint
groan of laughter. Mr. Curling looked
fiercely in his direction, and said, &#8220;Interest
is a sum of money allowed by us
for the use of the moneys left in our
hands. The rate is regulated by the Bank
of England. But all these things are
very simple matters: and I don&#8217;t doubt
that you will have them at your finger
ends in a very short time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I must confess that he spoke very
nicely; and I felt that if he would only
pull that atrocious ring off his forefinger,
I might not find him so objectionable as
I had feared. Nor was he so plain, now
that I examined him closely. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
certainly had good eyes and teeth, and
there was a delicacy in his hands which
even his ring could not deform. But his
dress was very clerkly, consisting of a
long frock coat, which he wore open, and
a waistcoat buttoned up to his throat,
scarcely showing a spotted cotton cravat,
ornamented with a pin. The back of his
head, moreover, was a convexity of black
friz. On the other hand, his voice was
pleasing, and his manners sufficiently
easy.</p>

<p>Before long my uncle bustled into the
bank, and on catching sight of me called
out in his cheery way, &#8220;There you are,
Charlie! How are you?&#8221; and came
behind the counter and shook hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, taking me aside,
&#8220;what I want to impress upon you is
this: master the details of banking as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
quickly as you can, and try and like
your work. Before long I shall hope to
be able to convince you that it will be
well worth your while to apply yourself.
In reality there is very little to learn.
The mere clerkly portion of the business
is nothing; any ploughboy could be
taught it in a week. The banker&#8217;s real
needs are, a good address, thorough amiability,
a high sense of honour, and a
good knowledge of human nature. You
understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly; and I may hope that I
am not deficient in some of the qualifications
you speak of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed you are not. Where you are
at present wanting, is in what I must
call practicality. You will have to fight
against some difficult prejudices which
you have brought with you out of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
life in Longueville. But,&#8221; he continued,
clapping me on the shoulders, &#8220;in spite
of some little weaknesses, there is enough
in you to persuade me that you will do
very well.&#8221; He then went into his
private room.</p>

<p>I almost forget how that day passed.
I had a seat on a high stool near Mr.
Curling&#8217;s desk, and I remember that
from time to time he would turn to
explain something in connexion with the
business, which, he told me, was important
to know. He went about his
work diligently and steadily, and particularly
amazed me by the extraordinary
capacity he manifested of counting any
amount of money in an incredibly short
space of time. Threepenny and fourpenny-bits,
half-sovereigns and half-crowns,
shillings and two-shilling-pieces, discharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
out of the queer old bags in which the
customers brought their hoards, fled like
lightning, under his nimble fingers, up
into a corner where they arranged themselves
in piles. Nor was his perception
of a bad or doubtful coin less remarkable.
Now and then he would stay his miraculous
counting to examine a piece of
money, give it a sharp ring, fling it
aside, and proceed in his work like a
machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were to live a thousand years,&#8221;
I thought, &#8220;and were I to devote twelve
hours of the day to counting money, I
should never be able to do what that
fellow does.&#8221;</p>

<p>I expressed my surprise, and he asked
me to try my hand on two pounds of
silver. It took me five minutes to tell
twenty pieces. &#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; said I, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
away, when he showed me that I
made eighteen shillings represent a pound,
&#8220;this is somebody else&#8217;s work, for it certainly
isn&#8217;t mine.&#8221; And then I began to
talk of the superiority of the French over
the English money.</p>

<p>Mr. Spratling worked like an automaton.
I thought his zeal contemptible, and wondered
that any human being should be
gifted with so little tact as not to know
how to qualify the vulgarity of labour
with an occasional dash of the gentility
of indolence. But speaking of him when
he had gone out at one o&#8217;clock to get
his dinner, my opinion of the youth was
greatly improved, by Mr. Curling telling
me that he got eighty pounds a year, on
which he supported his blind mother,
who had no other resources but her child&#8217;s
salary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>&#8220;By George!&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;he is a
worthy young man; and if I have any
influence with my uncle, I&#8217;ll get his salary
raised to a hundred pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how it came about, but I
have a clear recollection of leaving the
bank at four o&#8217;clock, in a much more
subdued mood than I had entered it.
I was under an engagement to my aunt
to dine at Grove End, but I felt so tired,
after my long and unaccustomed confinement
to one room, that I begged my
uncle to excuse me to her. Why was I
subdued? Perhaps because I was tired.
Does physical weariness take the conceit
out of one? if so, here you have a reason
for the change in me. I am willing to
look a little deeper, and attribute it
to a feeling of, perhaps, the only wholesome
pride that had ever stirred me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the pride of having been honestly occupied.</p>

<p>I left Mr. Curling still busy with his
accounts, but he had told me there was
no need for me to stay. I walked home
to my lodgings and dined off a chop and
half a pint of sherry, and then putting a
pipe in my mouth, strolled out in the
direction of the green lanes.</p>

<p>I was not much of a moralist in those
days, but my mood happening to be a
pliant one, certain thoughts seized the
opportunity to intrude themselves and
beget sundry reflections. I asked myself
if I was not carrying my notions of
gentility a little too far; if I was not
making a very grave blunder in conveying
the impression that I considered myself
too good and fine to engage in work in
which hundreds of men, in every sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
my equals, and in many senses my
betters, were employed? I enquired of
my common sense whether it were
possible for a gentleman&mdash;I don&#8217;t say a
real gentleman, for I am aware of only
one kind&mdash;to lose caste by adopting any
pursuit in which he could preserve his
honour and possess his proper dignity
securely? Was not an assumed ignorance
of the essential, if commonplace, interests
of life a very impertinent coxcombry?
Should I not be asserting myself as a
very despicable kind of fop if I professed
to look with contempt on a vocation of
which I had not pride enough to restrain
me from pocketing the profits?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t pretend to say that I answered
these questions in a manner such as a
severe moralist would approve. My self-conceit
was too tenacious of life to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
killed by a single blow, and my prejudices
were of too old a growth to be
tamed by a single wise reflection. I
merely wish to exhibit myself as having
been capable of sometimes thinking correctly,
however long it may have taken
me to bend my character into a conformity
with my better thoughts.</p>

<p>I so thoroughly enjoyed the fresh air
and the exquisite serenity of that May
evening, that, though you may conceive
I thought a good deal about Conny, I
don&#8217;t remember once regretting that I
had not gone to Grove End. It is good
for man to be sometimes alone. I am
pretty certain that my solitary walk was
more beneficial to me than a long
evening&#8217;s coquetting with my sweet cousin
would have been. Besides, I felt it only
right that I should not avail myself too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
persistently of my kind relations&#8217; hospitality.</p>

<p>As I entered a lane rich with evening
shadows, and cool with the fairy foliage
of high and stately trees, I saw in advance
of me a young man supporting on
his arm an elderly woman, whose hesitating
step persuaded me that she was
blind. I could not help taking notice of
the peculiar and loving care with which
her companion directed her; and I was
speculating on his aspect, which struck
me as familiar, when he looked round
and disclosed the features of Mr. Spratling.
I waved my hand to him and he
nodded; and, not choosing to pass them,
I halted, and pretended to examine the
country through the trees. I watched
them covertly, with increasing respect
and admiration for the obvious tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and love of the young fellow for
his helpless mother, until they were out
of sight, and then leisurely retraced my
steps, made pensive by regret that ever
I should have thought this young man,
who possessed in his rugged and stunted
form a deeper and lovelier humanity than
ever I could have dreamt of, unfit to be
a fellow-labourer of mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> will kindly imagine, on commencing
this chapter, that I have been three
weeks at the bank. My progress during
this time was not very remarkable; but
I was beginning to understand a good
deal that had threatened to remain for
ever unintelligible to me. I could now
add up a pretty long row of figures,
without being thrown by the effort into
great mental distress and confusion; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
began to understand why Mr. Jones was
allowed to overdraw his account, when
Mr. Robinson&#8217;s cheques were dismissed
with two terrible letters, or a mild
&#8220;please refer to drawer.&#8221; I knew the
object of pass-books, and the difference
between current and deposit accounts. I
could also comprehend the purport and
import of bills, promissory notes, and
such-like documents; and why Mr. Brown,
the rich grazier, who didn&#8217;t particularly
want money, was charged one per cent.
above the Bank rate if he borrowed, and
why Mr. Smith, who very particularly
wanted money, was charged four, and
even five per cent. above the Bank rate
if <i>he</i> borrowed.</p>

<p>For all this increasing knowledge of
mine, I was not a little indebted to Mr.
Curling, whom to recompense for his very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
obliging disposition, I did my utmost to
like. But whether it was owing to that
unfortunate ring of his, or to his curly
black hair, or to the cut of his clothes,
or to a lurking suspicion that he was in
love with Conny, I never could succeed
in transforming my gratitude into a feeling
of friendship. We had no sympathies
in common. He once asked me to take
a walk with him, and I went; but I
passed a very stupid time. He could
scarcely talk upon any other subject than
business and bank rates, and stock lists
and exchange prices. When by a very
free discussion of my own affairs, I invited
him to be equally candid, I found him
excessively cautious. He listened to and
encouraged <i>me</i> in my gossip about my
father and my life at Longueville, but
somehow contrived without positively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
seeming, to be absolutely silent on the
subject of his own history. He had
lodgings near the bank, and out of
curiosity I accepted his invitation one day
to spend an evening with him. I found
that he didn&#8217;t smoke. He pretended to
like the smell of my pipe, but I was so
sure that he did not, that I put it aside,
and he didn&#8217;t ask me to resume it. He
had only one room. His bed was up in
the corner; there were some books on
the mantelpiece, and writing materials on
a table near the window. He apologised
for the meanness of his accommodation,
and told me he had no other resources
outside his salary, which was the only
piece of personal information that, I think,
I ever succeeded in getting from him. I
had tried several times since I had known
him to induce him to talk about Conny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
in order to ascertain what his sentiments
really were towards her; but he was
never to be coaxed out of his shell. I
rather hoped, now, that the whiskey-and-water
would make him more candid; and,
not without tact, turned the conversation
upon my cousin. But he had one of
those folding minds which, like the tubes
of a telescope, slide deftly one within
another, so that, without appearing to
evade me, he yet succeeded in compressing
himself entirely out of my reach.
He asked me a week or two afterwards
to spend another evening with him; but
I declined under some pretence or other,
and he never repeated his invitation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was a constant visitor at
Grove End. My aunt and uncle never
varied in their kindness. Indeed, had
not the former been old enough to be my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
mother, I might fairly have considered
that she was head over ears in love with
me. She was perpetually referring to me
for my opinions; seemed indeed to regard
me as the very glass of fashion and the
mould of form, and to accept me as an
unerring standard of breeding and taste.
She was never more proud than when she
had me by her side in the carriage, and
returned the bows of her friends in the
street.</p>

<p>I should have been fearfully dull, but
for Grove End. A more dead-and-alive
town than Updown I very much question
if even Wales could produce. Not so
much as a street organ found its way
there. The only excitement that ever I
heard of was a magic lantern, the property
of the rector, who now and then
lent it out, when the Charity School<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
children stood in need of a little recreation.
It is very true that the surrounding
country was beautiful, and there was some
fishing to be had in the river. But I am
one of those people who soon get tired of
natural scenery. Nothing is prettier to
read about than cool glades, and sunny
hay-fields, and the smell of violets, and
the lazy lowing of cattle, and the metallic
echo of the scythe being sharpened, and
the songs of the rustics. A gentleman
will sit down in the library of his club
in Piccadilly, and declare himself, amid a
glowing description of rural beauties, an
ardent admirer of the country, which he
never explores further than Richmond.
I remember some verses written by
Captain Morris, which my father, who
had known the author, was very fond of
quoting:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Your magpies and stock-doves may flirt among trees</div>
<div class="verse">And chatter their transports in groves if they please;</div>
<div class="verse">But a house is much more to <i>my</i> taste than a tree,</div>
<div class="verse">And for groves! oh! a fine grove of chimneys for me!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>I say that I should have been sick of
Updown and the natural scenery around
it in less than a week, had it not been
for Grove End. But <i>there</i> I found a
human interest, powerful enough to inform
the country for miles round with an extraordinary
attraction.</p>

<p>Yes, Eugenio! before I had known my
cousin three weeks I was in love with her.
How could I look into her fathomless blue
eyes, and not sink deep&mdash;deep&mdash;deep
out of sight? How could I take her little
snow-white hand and not wish to hold
it for ever? My aunt encouraged me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
It was <i>her</i> fault. I noticed that she was
always fond of leaving Conny and me
alone; that she contrived that Conny and
I should sit side by side at the dinner-table;
and that Conny should accompany
us in our drives, which we used to take
after the bank was closed, the carriage
often calling for me at my lodgings.</p>

<p>I remember one fine evening at the
latter end of June, that I left the drawing-room
and strolled on to the lawn, and
seated myself under a fine old oak tree.
I wanted Conny to join me, and hoped
she would take the hint, or that her
mamma would send her with a cigar; for
as I have said, Mrs. Hargrave took great
pleasure in seeing us together. I made
up my mind, if Conny came, to tell her
that I loved her. I was suffering at that
moment from an access. Everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
knows that love is an intermittent fever,
and that the delirium is very powerful at
times. I had sat next to her at table;
I had said something soft to her, and lo!
she had turned her eyes slowly up to
mine. Heavens! what did I read there?
A sensibility that transported me! Could
I question that my unspoken love was
recognised and shared? Oh, Eugenio!
either hold thy tongue, or agree with me
instantly, that the spirit hath a voice
which makes itself audible to the spirit
of the beloved, albeit no human language
is uttered. Of course the eyes can talk.
They are faculties given to women to
convey thoughts which all the terms and
all the definitions in Dr. Johnson&#8217;s
Dictionary put together, could never express.
I had read a profound and inspiring
truth in Conny&#8217;s eyes. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
tongue could no more have said it than
<i>my</i> eyes could have looked it, beautiful
and piercing as my poor fat Pauline used
to consider them. That truth had sent
me to the old oak tree, and now kept me
pensively waiting for her to come forth.</p>

<p>But her mother came instead. The
kind old lady stepped on to the lawn,
and seeing me, approached and took a
seat at my side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how is it you are not smoking?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;to
tell you the truth, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this a beautiful evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beautiful indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you care to go back to Longueville?&#8221;
she inquired, rather slyly, I
thought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>I looked her full in the face, and she
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. I am perfectly satisfied
to remain where I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thomas says you are getting on
bravely at the bank. I know he is very
anxious that you should learn: for he
has some scheme for you, which he won&#8217;t
tell me. You see, wives don&#8217;t always
know their husbands&#8217; affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know he has some scheme, and I
am sure it is a generous one. I am
getting on&mdash;thanks to Mr. Curling, I
know a good deal now, though, when I
first began, I thought I should never be
able to learn the work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of this Mr.
Curling? Do you like him?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>&#8220;I ought to: he deserves that I
should.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said my aunt, &#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t. I
am sure he is a very sly person, and I
dislike slyness in man or woman. When
he visited this house he used to pay Conny
a great deal of attention, but always in
a sly way. In doing so, he took a very
great liberty, considering his position in
life, although my husband laughs at me,
and declares that I troubled myself more
than the occasion needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Curling is certainly no match for
Conny,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Match!&#8221; cried my aunt, warmly, &#8220;I
should think not. Why, all that we
know of him is, that he comes from
London, from which place he answered
an advertisement that Thomas put in the
papers for a clerk. I have no wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
say anything harsh of the young man;
but he obliges me to think of what he
is when he pays my daughter attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make head or tail of him,&#8221; I
answered. &#8220;I have frequently tried to get
him to talk about Conny, but he always
contrives to glide away from the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! he <i>is</i> sly&mdash;I have always
said he is sly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, after all, aunt, what matters it
if Mr. Curling <i>does</i> admire Conny? People
can only be prevented from touching&mdash;not
from looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Curling is welcome to
admire,&#8221; replied my aunt, with pleasant
disdain. &#8220;All that I want to be assured
of is, that Conny doesn&#8217;t care about
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she does; at least,&#8221; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
added, with a twinge of jealousy, &#8220;she
has never given me to understand by
word or look that she cares a farthing
for him. If I thought she did&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked my aunt anxiously,
seeing that I paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; I answered gloomily,
folding my arms Lara-wise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope, Charlie, you have no reason
to fear she <i>does</i> like that young man? If
I really believed this to be the case, I
should desire my husband to dismiss
him at once. I wouldn&#8217;t have such
a scandal&mdash;no! not to save my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear aunt, it is you who make me
suspicious. <i>I</i> myself have heard and seen
nothing. They don&#8217;t write to each other,
I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>&#8220;Write! I should think not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they never meet each other
alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I hardly see that there is anything
to fear. If Conny were in love
with Curling&mdash;the mere idea puts me in
a passion!&mdash;I say, if Conny were silly
enough to waste her priceless affection
on a fellow of that kind, you would soon
find it out. Something or other would
happen. Either she&#8217;d meet him alone
and be seen, or one of their letters would
be intercepted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the mere idea <i>is</i> enough to put
one in a passion. As to her meeting him
alone or writing to him, that is out of
the question. She is my child, and I
can answer for her conduct.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, she tells her own story. She is
deliciously artless and womanly, and inexpressibly
pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is as God made her,&#8221; said my
aunt, meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father would be charmed with
her. After a course of sophistication,
such as you meet with among French
women, such English simplicity, such quiet
artless sweetness as Conny&#8217;s is a pure
luxury.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and she get on very well together,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be very miserable if I
thought she didn&#8217;t like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be,&#8221; answered my aunt,
with a smiling nod, &#8220;for I know she does
like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; I cried, with a dramatic
start.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t she?&#8221; and here she
paid me a compliment I need not repeat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray spare my lovely blushes,&#8221; I said,
laughing. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t follow because
you are so kind as to like me that
Conny should. Mothers and daughters
seldom agree in taste&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, unfortunately, my uncle came
out, followed by Conny, just as our conversation
was growing thrillingly interesting.
But for this interruption, I should
have told my aunt that I was in love
with her daughter, asked her consent, and
inquired whether she thought a proposal
for marriage would be agreeable to my
uncle. As for <i>her</i>, I had eyes to see,
and ears to hear, and therefore knew that
she was decidedly in my favour, and
needed no entreaty to become my warm
ally. It was plain that Mr. Curling was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
a nightmare of hers, and had I been a
trickster, nothing would have been easier
for me than to have played upon her
fears, and compassed my ends speedily
through them. But I had too good an
opinion of myself to condescend to stratagems
of any kind. Conny should love
me for myself&mdash;not through any compulsion
on her mamma&#8217;s part. As yet, I
was practically ignorant of her feelings
towards me; a certain theory had indeed
been inspired by her eyes; but talk as
you will of the language of the soul, we
are never heartily satisfied until we have
listened to the language of the lips.</p>

<p>The opportunity for acquainting her
with my sentiments was gone for that
night, for my uncle stuck to me during
the rest of the time we were out of doors,
talking chiefly about banking business, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
which I had to listen in order to gratify
him by my replies; and when we returned
to the house we all sat in the drawing-room,
so that any confidential talk was
out of the question.</p>

CHAPTER VII.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Would not any man in his senses run diametrically
from you, and as far as his legs would carry him, rather
than thus carelessly, foolishly, and foolhardily expose
himself afresh and afresh, where his heart and his
reason tell him he shall be sure to come off loser, if not
totally undone?&#8221;&mdash;<i>Sterne.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day was Sunday. I met my relatives
at church, and returned with them
to an early dinner at Grove End. Whilst
at church I had not particularly noticed
Conny&#8217;s manner, but as we walked to
the house it struck me that she appeared
very downcast. On the other hand, Mrs.
Hargrave was in high spirits, undamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
by a long and tedious sermon, and unrestrained
by any sense of the solemnity
of the day. She carried on quite a little
flirtation with her husband, who submitted
to her playfulness very amiably,
and, whilst I walked between her and
her daughter, entertained me with various
reminiscenses of her young days, and of
Thomas&#8217;s courtship.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was absurdly in love with me,&#8221;
she observed, referring to her patient
helpmate. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t like me to tell
you what he threatened to do if I
refused to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; said my uncle, &#8220;Charlie
would rather read a chapter of English
History, and learn a good deal at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; returned my
aunt. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that we had anything
to do with history.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>&#8220;What you are talking about occurred
in George the Fourth&#8217;s reign. There
were wars and civil dissensions in those
days which Charlie would rather hear
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let your husband silence you,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;Of course he was absurdly in
love with you. What do you think,
Conny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t live in those days,&#8221; answered
Conny absently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am very happy,&#8221; said my
aunt, passing her hand through her
husband&#8217;s arm. &#8220;I only hope that Conny
may have my good fortune,&#8221; and she
glanced askance at her daughter and me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confess, my dear, that you would
rather have had Edward,&#8221; exclaimed my
uncle with a deep smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean what you say. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
even if I had, I should only have acted
as most women do, who invariably want
the wrong man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Conny looked at me from under her
parasol and smiled. What did she mean
by smiling?</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a great deal of nonsense
talked about marriage,&#8221; said my uncle.
&#8220;My idea is, that every young man
should get a wife as soon as he can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my idea, too,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;And mine,&#8221; exclaimed my aunt.</p>

<p>Thus fortified&mdash;how strong a man feels
in his wife&#8217;s acquiescence! but then she
must often contradict him&mdash;my uncle
continued, &#8220;For what is a man without
a home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A vagabond,&#8221; cried my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right, my dear; for a vagabond
means a wanderer.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>&#8220;I am always suspicious of men without
homes&mdash;of men who live in clubs or
lodgings,&#8221; observed my aunt. &#8220;Of course
I am not speaking of young men who
haven&#8217;t had time to get married,&#8221; she
added apologetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man is not respectable without a
home,&#8221; said my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he can&#8217;t have a home without a
wife,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;How hot it is!&#8221; exclaimed Conny, a
little peevishly. &#8220;This road is so dreadfully
dazzling to the eyes, that I can
hardly see. What a pity people mayn&#8217;t
use their carriages on a Sunday!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! we ought all to go afoot to
God&#8217;s house,&#8221; said my uncle. &#8220;The day
we dedicate to Him should be a levelling
day&mdash;a reminder to rich and poor of their
common mortality. But little piety will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
be left in the bosom of a hard-working
labourer who, on quitting his place in the
free seats, comes out and sees the rich
saints luxuriously rolling homewards in
fine carriages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember what your papa says,
Conny,&#8221; remarked my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why poor people should
feel more on Sundays than on week days,&#8221;
answered Conny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they do,&#8221; said my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is better,&#8221; I exclaimed, as we
turned into the long shady lane that led
to my uncle&#8217;s house. But Conny seemed
rather sulky, and for the rest of the walk
remained silent.</p>

<p>In spite of my aunt&#8217;s cheerfulness, we
were not so brisk a party at the dinner-table
as we usually were. Conny complained
of the heat, which, she said, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
depressed her. For my part, I did not
find it so very hot. The windows were
wide open, and there was just enough air
abroad to make the temperature of the
atmosphere perfectly luxurious. However,
Conny was in one of those moods which
render grievances necessary conditions of
life. &#8220;She is not <i>all</i> sweetness!&#8221; I
thought. But that discovery didn&#8217;t weaken
my admiration. I was just of that age when
a man will love a woman through everything,
and for everything; through spleen
and sauciness; for fickleness and flirtation;
through bad grammar, and for gross relations;
when he finds that everything she
wears becomes her, that everything she
says makes her more enchanting; when
he mistakes temper for spirit, and many
other things for many other things. I
think, had my cousin stood on her head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
I should have considered her posture the
most graceful and becoming one in the
world.</p>

<p>My uncle, dyspeptic as usual, was, in
spite of his sufferings, garrulous. The little
flirtation my aunt had indulged him in,
had put him into a thoroughly self-satisfied
humour. Once more he got upon the
subject of marriage, and dogmatised in a
very inspiriting manner. However, it
turned out that my aunt was not so amicably
disposed as he imagined; for, on
his happening to say, that a true woman,
if she loved a man, would follow him into
a garret, and be content to make her bed
on a sand-floor, his wife confounded
him, by crying out, &#8220;Nonsense! the true
woman who will act in such a manner is
a true fool! A man who is really fond
of a woman, wouldn&#8217;t take her to a sand-floor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
but, if he should offer to do so,
the woman ought to refuse him, because
his offer would be a sure sign that he
didn&#8217;t love her as he ought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very good logic,&#8221; said I,
approvingly. &#8220;But still,&#8221; I continued,
&#8220;it is quite possible, and even reasonable,
for a poor man to be devoted to a
girl, to long to possess her, and to marry
her without thinking of the poverty to
which he will take her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More shame to him!&#8221; said my aunt,
who now differed from me for the first
time since I had known her.</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;but then he may
hope, before long, to put her into a comfortable
position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t,&#8221; interrupted my uncle.
&#8220;You might as well expect a kettle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
not to boil after putting it on the
fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there is another side of the question,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;which ought to be considered&mdash;speaking
for myself, I should
seriously doubt a girl&#8217;s love for me if she
refused to marry me, simply because I
couldn&#8217;t put her into a good house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma doesn&#8217;t understand love,&#8221; said
Conny, querulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma does,&#8221; replied my aunt, with
a severe nod; &#8220;but papa doesn&#8217;t, and
you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at Conny just in time to
catch sight of her little mouth twisted
queerly at the corners.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have said that of me,
when George the Fourth was on the
throne,&#8221; said my uncle to his wife, with
a wink at me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re always talking about George
the Fourth,&#8221; replied my aunt, fanning
herself with a napkin. &#8220;One would think
that he lived in Henry the Eighth&#8217;s time.
He only died a few years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did he die, Conny?&#8221; asked her
papa. &#8220;You are well read in history.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please, don&#8217;t let us argue any
more,&#8221; said Conny. &#8220;It is too hot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marriage,&#8221; said I, feeling that I would
give worlds to take and squeeze Conny&#8217;s
hand under the table-cloth, &#8220;is one of
those things you can&#8217;t reason about. The
moth flies to the candle, and takes no
thought of whither he goeth or what will
become of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether,&#8221; continued my uncle, &#8220;the
flame that attracts him is made by a
farthing dip or by virgin wax.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, or whether it illuminates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
splendours of a royal drawing-room, or
the sordid squalor of a pauper&#8217;s hovel,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what you are talking
about,&#8221; exclaimed my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;We do, though, Charlie&mdash;don&#8217;t we,&#8221;
said my uncle with great glee. &#8220;But
Conny looks bored, and my wife puzzled;
so we&#8217;ll talk of feathers and rouge.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw nothing of my cousin all the
afternoon. Yes&mdash;once I caught a glimpse
of her at her bed-room window as my
uncle and I sat chatting on the lawn. I
had it several times in my mind to tell
my uncle what my feelings were for
Conny, and to receive his opinion on the
subject; but I thought I should be acting
more wisely if, before speaking to her
papa, I first of all ascertained what
Conny&#8217;s views were. I rather wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
that my uncle never made any allusion
to my admiration, not to say my love,
which I thought must surely be as plain
as the daylight. He could be confidential
enough on other matters. I supposed he
must have a pretty good notion that I
couldn&#8217;t be in the society of so charming
a creature every day without conceiving a
very sentimental affection for her. My
aunt suspected the truth, and relished it;
why did my uncle choose to be so regardless?
He appeared so thoroughly fond of
me that I could not question the pleasure
he would feel on hearing that I wanted
to marry his child. The only possible
objection he could offer to an alliance
which could not fail to gratify his pride
of family, was&mdash;my &#8220;circumstances&#8221;&mdash;which,
to speak the truth, were not what
the Barings or the Rothschilds would call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
splendid. But then, Conny would have
money enough for both of us to cut a
very considerable figure with; and what
would it matter on which side the fortune
lay, so long as it lay between us?</p>

<p>Conny made her appearance at tea-time,
and though she met my admiring gaze
very steadily, I could not help thinking
that she had been crying. There was
just the faintest tinge of red round the
rim of the eyes, whilst the eyes themselves
looked soft and humid. I waited
to see if her father or mother would
notice these signs, but as they did not, I
concluded that my suspicions were wrong,
and that the effect I noticed was due to
the heat, of which she had complained.</p>

<p>She had changed her dress since dinner,
and now appeared in white muslin. Her
arms and throat were bare, and down her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
back, almost to her waist, fell the
long gold-coloured curl she always
wore.</p>

<p>&#8220;And beauty leads us with a single
hair,&#8221; said I, taking the curl between my
fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were a single hair it wouldn&#8217;t
lead you,&#8221; she answered, with a coquettish
manner that appeared to me perfectly
natural, and thoroughly undeceived me
in my notion that she had been crying.
&#8220;Men like women to have plenty of
hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should tell Charlie that your
hair is all your own,&#8221; exclaimed my aunt,
looking proudly at her child.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be told; I have eyes
to see,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s her own, take my word for it,&#8221;
said my uncle. &#8220;I thank heaven that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the dead have not been despoiled nor
the living shorn to contribute to that
show of hair. I only wonder that
people can be found to skewer dead or
distressed females&#8217; tresses among their
own locks. I should as soon think of
wearing another man&#8217;s skull, were I dissatisfied
with the shape of my own, as
of gumming another fellow&#8217;s curls over
my baldness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some things that are better
not thought of,&#8221; said I, &#8220;buns, cooking,
and wigs among them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why buns?&#8221; asked my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said I, &#8220;I am told that
they are the platform on which bare-footed
bakers are sometimes accustomed
to dance a saraband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Faugh!&#8221; cried my aunt.</p>

<p>Conny ran out into the garden. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
going to follow her, when she came back
holding a rosebud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put that in my hair,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and
let me see what taste you have.&#8221;</p>

<p>I ought to have possessed Uncle Toby&#8217;s
simplicity when he looked into the Widow
Wadman&#8217;s eye, and attended earnestly to
what I was about, instead of thinking
of other things, for then, perhaps, I
should have pleased her. As it was, I
put the rose in the wrong place, when
she whipped it out, and smartly bade me
try again.</p>

<p>My aunt looked delighted: my uncle
amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where will you have it?&#8221; I enquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the right place, of course,&#8221; she
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said I, &#8220;don&#8217;t face the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
glass, but be good enough to look at
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>You may believe I took some time in
satisfying myself; putting the rose now
on one side, now on the other side, stepping
elegantly backwards to inspect her
sweet face, touching with reverent fingers
her golden locks, and twisting them round
and round my heart in so complicated a
mesh, that the fly whom a spider has
spun upon its sticky threads is not a
securer prisoner; until my uncle, losing
patience, cried out,</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let us have tea, or we shall
be late for church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie has put the rose in very
becomingly,&#8221; said my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it will do very nicely,&#8221; responded
my cousin, peeping at herself in the glass.
Then, while she made the tea, she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
&#8220;I feel too tired to go to church to-night,
mamma.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what has tired you?&#8221; asked
her papa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, unless it is the heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The garden will be deliciously cool,
this evening,&#8221; I observed. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll
stay at home too, and keep my cousin
company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; said my aunt.</p>

<p>My uncle sipped his tea, and appeared
to take no notice.</p>

<p>But Conny exclaimed, &#8220;Oh, Charlie,
please don&#8217;t stop at home for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you dear little flirt!&#8221; I thought;
&#8220;it needs no Solomon to understand the
English of your &#8216;don&#8217;ts.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be sorry to be thought irreligious,&#8221;
I said: &#8220;but I can&#8217;t help saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
that I would rather stay at home this
evening, than go to church.&#8221;</p>

<p>Did Conny pout? Did a little frown
gather upon Conny&#8217;s white forehead? I
couldn&#8217;t be sure&mdash;she turned her head so
quickly aside. But even had I been sure
that she pouted and frowned, I should
never have doubted for a moment that
her choosing not to go to church, was a
hint for me to remain with her. Come,
Eugenio, you are a judge of human
nature&mdash;tell me, what did that little
episode of the rosebud mean? What, my
friend, but the delicate proem, the
crimson-coloured preface, the sweet, the
graceful, the womanly initialing of the
Arcadian scene she wanted me to rehearse
with her?</p>

<p>She said no more, but drank her tea
in silence, looking at the clock now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
then, and sometimes out of window,
until her mamma having left the room to
put on her things, whilst her papa read a
letter he had taken out of his pocket-book,
she sidled up to me and whispered,
with her eyes full of sweetness, and with
the tenderest blush on her fair face,</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish, Charlie, you wouldn&#8217;t stop at
home for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you very deeply concerned for my
spiritual welfare?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure mamma would rather have
you with her. She is <i>so</i> fond of you,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No living being could appreciate her
kindness more than I do; but I would
rather risk her displeasure than miss the
chance of being with you alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>In those ignorant days I used to think
that a woman&#8217;s wishes were to be read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
backwards, like a witch&#8217;s prayers. Since
then I have learned that this is not true.
I gave Conny a smile to let her see that
I thoroughly understood her, and heartily
appreciated the delicate sense of embarrassment
that made her anxious for
me not to imagine, &amp;c., and then praised
the charming effect produced by the contrast
of the red rosebud against her
sunny hair. She said &#8220;Oh!&#8221; and &#8220;Ah!&#8221;
and &#8220;Yes?&#8221; and &#8220;Indeed?&#8221; and grew
very absent.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is wondering,&#8221; I thought to myself,
&#8220;whether I mean to propose this
evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before long Mrs. Hargrave put her
head into the room to tell her husband
that she was ready; whereupon my uncle
pocketed his letter, and giving us a nod,
went out. I watched them leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
house&mdash;my uncle walking a yard or two
behind his wife, as people who have been
long married often do&mdash;and then said to
Conny, &#8220;Let us go and stroll in the
grounds.&#8221; She made no answer, but went
upstairs to get her hat, and returned after
a short absence, looking very docile and
even frightened. I noticed as I held the
door open for her to pass out, that she
looked at the clock, making perhaps the
tenth time she had done so in less than
twenty minutes. But I was in the
humour to interpret every action of hers,
into a compliment to myself, and was
quite willing to believe that this farewell
peep at the clock was merely meant to
satisfy herself that she would have two
good hours with me alone before her papa
and mamma returned.</p>

<p>The grounds covered pretty nearly seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
acres. They were wonderfully well tended,
and had been laid out with great judgment
and good taste. They were richly
stocked with trees; at one extremity was
a fine orchard; the wilder aspects of
nature had been judiciously preserved, and
among the trees, in some portions of the
estate, you would have imagined yourself
in the wilds of a forest. The evening
was beautiful, beyond the power of language
to describe. The sun shone brightly,
but with the mellow and tender light
that it takes in its descent, and which
deepens upon it as it nears the western
horizon. Under the trees a soft and
fairy-like night had gathered, though here
and there the sunshine streamed through
the branches, and bathed the deep green
grass with pools of yellow splendour.
Far and near, the pink hills reared their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
wooded ridges to the sky; while the
quiet breeze rang with the silvery chimes
of the distant church-bells.</p>

<p>&#8220;Englishmen are quite right in believing
in their country,&#8221; said I. &#8220;It is
the finest place in the world to live in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You like it better than France?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like Updown better than Longueville,
certainly. What makes you smile?
I suppose you think me capricious and
unfaithful to my old affections.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet I am sure you find Updown
very much duller than Longueville.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay I should, if it were not
for Grove End.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are dull enough here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> am not. I am very happy. I
know I should be very sorry to go back
to Longueville, unless I could return to
it on my own terms.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>&#8220;What are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all, I should wish to take
you with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Charlie,&#8221; she exclaimed, striking
at the grass with her parasol, &#8220;I hope
you are not going to talk any nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It all depends,&#8221; I replied, gravely,
&#8220;on what you call nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flattery is nonsense, and compliments,
and personal remarks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Conny, I haven&#8217;t flattered
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See how fine the trees look, and the
sky. Let us talk about Wordsworth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather talk about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? A man mayn&#8217;t marry his
grandmother, but it is nowhere written
that a man mayn&#8217;t talk of his cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>She laughed at this, but made no reply.
Though she had answered me pretty
briskly, I was nevertheless struck by her
air, which was at once subdued and uneasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you thinking about, Conny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you thinking of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I be thinking of you,
when I tell you I was thinking of
nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder whether you have a good
opinion of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you care what my
opinion is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. I want you to like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be very wicked not to like
you, considering we are relations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let us talk of relations.
There is a brotherly-sisterly twang about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the word which is effective enough in
tracts, but which disagreeably affects
the mind that is engrossed with worldly
considerations. I want you to do more
than like me&mdash;I want you to love
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She grew pale and stooped her head,
then turning her eyes up to me, said
with a forced, nervous laugh,</p>

<p>&#8220;I have begged you not to talk any
nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not nonsense to me. I am
deeply in earnest. I love you, Conny,
and shan&#8217;t be happy unless you love me
in return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her head dropped again. My heart
thumped like an Irish valet&#8217;s fist upon a
door. I strained my ear to catch the
breathless whisper, but no whisper came.
Raising her head suddenly, she said,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>&#8220;It is mamma&#8217;s wish that I should
marry you. She came to my room last
night, and told me to prepare for an
offer of marriage. I think you ought to
have spoken to me first, before speaking
to her. It would have been fairer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken to her!&#8221; I exclaimed, greatly
astonished. &#8220;Why, I have never breathed
my feelings for you to a living creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could she have known?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must have guessed the truth by
my manner. She must have seen, as
everybody with eyes must, that I was in
love with you. I am very glad to have
her sanction; but I can assure you I
have never yet sought it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here came another pause, and then I
said, &#8220;I hope you believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes; but I was pained when
mamma said she wished me to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
you if you proposed, because&mdash;because
I haven&#8217;t had time to fall in love with
you yet, Charlie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here I caught hold of her hand, and
said&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what. What man
<i>does</i> know what he says when he makes
love? It is wonderful that I can recollect
so much as I have set down. I doubt if
even Boswell, who was born with a note-book
in his hand, could remember all the
observations he had occasion to make,
both to the lady he did marry and to the
great number of ladies he didn&#8217;t marry.
I don&#8217;t think I talked like a hero. I
don&#8217;t fancy I made use of any of those
striking and powerful expressions which
I strongly suspect must have been first
brought into fashion among novelists
by good-natured elderly women, who had
either never experienced or had forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the characteristics of love-making among
thinking beings. To conceal nothing, I
don&#8217;t think I said very much at all.
&#8220;Will you love me?&#8221; and &#8220;Ho, won&#8217;t
you love me?&#8221; and &#8220;Ah! can&#8217;t you love
me?&#8221; and &#8220;Please, try to love me,&#8221; with
an occasional Oh and a No, and a sigh,
and a smile, and a blush from her, comprise,
Eugenio, pretty much all that was
said and done between us. I looked
without sighing, and she sighed without
looking. I sink&mdash;sank&mdash;sunk my voice
into a whisper, and was about to express
a very poetical and touching sentiment,
when she interrupted me by crying out,
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that seven o&#8217;clock striking?&#8221; and
before I could collect my senses, so as
to enable me to listen to the distant bell
and answer her, behold! she exclaimed,
&#8220;I will be back in a few minutes,&#8221; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
ran&mdash;yes, <i>ran</i>&mdash;with great speed and surprising
grace, down the grounds and out
of sight.</p>

<p>Much astonished, I beheld her disappear,
and then pulling out a cigar,
lighted it, and sank, carefully, and after
a narrow inspection, upon the grass, at
the foot of a tree, and there, like Tityrus,
supine but not careless laid, waited for
her to return. I tried to think over
what I had said to her, and how, on the
whole, it struck me, she had received my
fervid language; but I found myself
chiefly wondering what on earth had
drawn her away so hastily, and what connection
seven o&#8217;clock could have with a
proceeding so entirely disagreeable and
undesirable.</p>

<p>In about five minutes&#8217; time, however,
I saw her returning through the trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
She smiled very sweetly on seeing me
seated and smoking, and exclaimed with
indescribable sauciness, &#8220;I think you are
very wise to rest yourself after your late
severe attack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; I answered a little sarcastically,
&#8220;that you didn&#8217;t run away from
me because you were afraid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she exclaimed, with serene
candour shining in her countenance; &#8220;one
of the servants&mdash;but I mustn&#8217;t tell stories
out of school. This is my little secret;
so ask me no questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>must</i> ask you one question,&#8221; I replied,
melted and won over as any
petulant child is with a sweetmeat, by
her delightful manner, &#8220;will you give me
leave to love you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, listen to me, Charlie,&#8221; said she,
laying her little hand on my arm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
upturning her celestial eyes, so that I
could see my own lovely features gazing
at me out of them, like twin cherubs
leaning forth from the blue vaults of
paradise. &#8220;You have not yet given me
time to love you; and I have determined
never to marry until I <i>do</i> love. I like
you very much now, and that is all I
mean to say for the present. You&#8217;ll
never be able to make me love you by
constantly questioning me. You must
take this for my answer, and not say
another word about what has passed
between us until I give you leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how long are you going to take?&#8221;
said I, fretfully. &#8220;You put me in the
position of a child who is told to shut its
eyes and open its mouth, and see what
it will get; whereby it may get the lock-jaw,
to say nothing of the exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
mental torture it is subjected to by blindness
under such conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, we must all learn to be patient
in this world,&#8221; she answered, with a look
of real sadness in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Conny,&#8221; said I, raising her hand
to my lips, &#8220;I am so much in love with
you, that I will do anything you want&mdash;though
I would rather you ordered me
to hang myself than wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go in, I begin to feel the air
a little chilly.&#8221;</p>

<p>We walked to the house; but, as I had
not finished my cigar, and as, so far
from feeling the air chilly, I found it
peculiarly mild and delightful, I said I
would remain on the lawn, making sure,
of course, that she would join me. She
went into the house, and I walked to the
seat under the oak-tree, where I sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
waiting and watching, and watching and
waiting, and wondering where she was,
and what she was doing, until my cigar
was burned out, and the evening had fairly
fallen; when I rose and entered the
drawing-room, expecting to find her there.
Then I peeped into the dining-room, and
then into the library. &#8220;She is in her
bed-room,&#8221; I thought; and not very well
knowing what to do with myself, I returned
to the grounds.</p>

<p>I could not help reflecting that I had
not gained much by not going to church.
&#8220;It is true,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;that she knows
I love her; but her answers were very
unsatisfactory.&#8221; Was she in love with
somebody else? Was his vulgar name
Curling? Why hadn&#8217;t I asked her? and
supposing I had? would she have told
me the truth?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>Just as I got to the conservatory, I,
to my infinite amazement, saw her coming
out from among the trees&mdash;those trees
within whose gloom her figure had faded,
on the clock striking seven.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were on the lawn,
smoking?&#8221; she exclaimed. She pronounced
the word smoking, &#8220;thmoking.&#8221;
Heavens! how I loved that one lisp!
And I fancied she blushed, but it was
almost too dark to see clearly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I thought you were in your
bed-room,&#8221; I replied, with the proper
severity of a suspicious wretch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we were both wrong,&#8221; she said,
laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the particular attraction of
those trees?&#8221; I asked, looking hard at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my secret,&#8221; she answered, with
a little rebellious toss of the head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>&#8220;You found the air chilly just now.
I don&#8217;t feel that it has grown warmer
since you left me,&#8221; said I, holding my
hand out and looking upwards, like a
man in search of rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; she
exclaimed, in a rather tremulous voice.
&#8220;I suppose I may go into the grounds
without any insinuations being made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Insinuations!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Heaven forbid!
Who insinuates? I have been
waiting for you on the lawn, and wishing
for you to join me; but as you had
left the grounds because you said you
felt chilly, I was surprised to find you
in them again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And pray,&#8221; asked she, getting up her
courage, and looking at me pertly, &#8220;what
is the <i>awful</i> conclusion you draw from
finding me here?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>&#8220;That you want to avoid me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I don&#8217;t, Charlie,&#8221; she answered
quite softly and tenderly, and laying that
bewitching little white hand of hers once
again upon my arm. &#8220;But I gave you
a hint about a servant, didn&#8217;t I? and I
told you not to ask me any questions.
Some of these days, I daresay, we shall
be <i>very</i> confidential; and now I will go
with you to the drawing-room, and sing
you a piece from the &#8216;Stabat Mater.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>And with the archest look in the world,
this most puzzling, seductive, repelling
little creature passed her hand through
my arm, and led me into the house.</p>

CHAPTER VIII.</h2></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Don Jer.</i> &#8220;I&#8217;ll let them see how merry an old man
can be.&#8221;&mdash;<i>The Duenna.</i></p></blockquote>


<p><span class="smcap">I may</span> value myself upon one quality,
which, when I was young, was in a great
measure due to the high opinion I had of
myself; I was always fond of keeping my
promises, and being regarded as a man of
my word.</p>

<p>I had informed Mr. Curling, shortly
after I joined the bank, that I should
apply to my uncle for an increase of
salary for Mr. Spratling. I did so that
same Sunday evening I had passed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
making love to Conny, and pleaded
Spratling&#8217;s case so well, dwelt so pathetically
upon his affection for his mother,
and on the effect produced on me when
I witnessed the care he took of her as
they walked, that my uncle told me he
would raise the young man&#8217;s salary ten
pounds next day. He seemed much
pleased to find I could take any interest
in a matter of this kind, as his notion
was that I looked down upon both my
fellow-clerks with huge contempt. At
supper that night, he spoke of the favour
I had requested, and my aunt was pleased
to make me a very handsome compliment,
though I was much more gratified by the
smile Conny gave me, and the quite new
expression of interest in her face with
which I caught her regarding me.</p>

<p>Next morning I had the pleasure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
telling Mr. Spratling what I had done
for him; and the way in which he slipped
off his stool and pressed my hand, looking
wistfully into my face, as if he were
made sad by the want of language to
express his feelings, quite affected me.
Mr. Curling was immensely polite and
officiously instructive. &#8220;You have made
two worthy people very happy to-day,&#8221;
he whispered. I smiled rather coldly,
for my unaccountable prejudice against
this gentleman was daily increasing, and
I wanted nothing from him but the bare
instruction he was capable of giving
me.</p>

<p>I was leaning with my hands behind
me against the empty fireplace in the
bank, thinking, I daresay, of Conny, when
the swinging doors were pushed rather
violently open, and a tall, stout man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
dressed in a frock-coat and a broad-brimmed
hat, the felt of which appeared
to be brushed the wrong way, came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Hargrave within?&#8221; he inquired
in a loud voice, pulling off his
hat, and wiping his forehead with a huge
pocket-handkerchief, at the same time
staring at me in a manner, I thought,
uncommonly rude. I returned his stare
with a great deal of assurance, not even
changing my posture, having no doubt
that he was some old farmer who wanted
to open an account at the bank.</p>

<p>Mr. Spratling went to tell my uncle
he was wanted. Meanwhile, my tall, stout
friend, never removed his eyes from my
face. Presently my uncle came out of
his little back office, and had no sooner
caught sight of the individual who wanted
him, than he shouted out,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>&#8220;What! Dick! why, my dear boy,
who on earth would have expected to see
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you? how are you, Tom?&#8221;
replied the other, looking at my uncle
for a moment, and immediately reverting
to me. Then, throwing his handkerchief
violently into his hat, which he had placed
on the counter, he called out, pointing
to me, &#8220;Tom, if that isn&#8217;t Charlie&#8217;s son,
hang, draw, and quarter me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course it is,&#8221; replied my
uncle. &#8220;Here, Charlie, let me introduce
you to your uncle Richard.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went up to the counter, and my uncle
Richard gripped my hand with a squeeze,
that left my fingers bloodless.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Charlie as he was at five-and-twenty&mdash;but
better-looking!&#8221; he roared,
pulling me hard against the counter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
examining my face with a broad grin on
his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, come in, this way, both of
you!&#8221; called out my uncle Tom; and
then shutting the door, he made us sit
down. I looked at this fresh uncle of
mine with unmixed curiosity. He was
as unlike Tom as Tom was unlike my
father. He had a fat, broad, English face,
with immense double-chins, little strips
of whiskers, sharp black eyes, and a head
very nearly bald. He was as tall as my
father, and about three times as big.
Indeed, he only wanted a pair of top-boots,
and a bottle-coloured cut-away
coat, to have figured as a living reproduction
of the picture of the traditional
Mr. John Bull.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you told me he was with
you,&#8221; said he, addressing his brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
and by the &#8220;he&#8221; meaning me, &#8220;but I
should never have remembered it had I
not caught the likeness. And how&#8217;s the
major? and what is he doing? Why,
he deserves to be changed into a frog,
for living all his life out of England,
and never coming to see a man. How
is he? how is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well indeed,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he ever talk of his brother
Dick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>I should have been nearer the truth
had I said &#8220;Oh no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i>&#8217;m his brother Dick. Gad take me!
you stared, young &#8217;un, as if I were a
witch. Do I look as if I could ride a
broomstick? hey? hey?&#8221; And he burst
into a roar of laughter, so loud that I
was almost stunned.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>&#8220;And what&#8217;s brought you here, Dick?&#8221;
said my uncle Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m thinking of breeding some
nags, Tom, and have come to look at
&#8216;Young Sidney,&#8217; belonging to Dixon, of
the Three Geese; a good horse, my lad,
rising four years old, sixteen and a quarter
high: his dam, Tom, a Yorkshire mare,
by &#8216;Slipslop,&#8217; a splendid brute I wanted
to buy, but that fellow Solomons wouldn&#8217;t
part with her at my price. That&#8217;s some
years since. So I told Teazer I&#8217;d run
over here and see the animal, and have
a look at the wife and Conny. How are
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. You&#8217;ll sleep at Grove End?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but I shall want to be away
early. Wednesday&#8217;s settling-day on the
Stock Exchange, and I must be in town
to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you bring Teazer with
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, somebody must be left to look
after the plate. Young &#8217;un,&#8221; said he to
me, &#8220;are you any judge of horses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I know nothing of horses, nor of
clothes&#8217; horses either,&#8221; I replied, hardly
relishing his freedom before my uncle
Tom, whose behaviour to me was
uniformly courteous and even deferential;
and yet not choosing to resent it, for fear
of being made to cut a ridiculous figure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! he&#8217;s a wag, Tom. Is that a
French pun, nephew?&#8221; he asked, with a
droll wink at his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now?&#8221;
said uncle Tom, coming to my rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I shall go and get a basin of
soup at Dixon&#8217;s, and then drive over to
Grove End?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>&#8220;Lunch with my wife&mdash;you&#8217;ll be in
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; now that I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;ll
have a talk with Philpotts, your nursery-man,
about some seed he&#8217;s advertising.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The phaeton will be here at four;
join us. We&#8217;ll drive you to Grove End.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered my stout uncle,
rising laboriously. &#8220;Good-bye for the
present, Tom; good-bye, young &#8217;un.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he strode out of the bank, making
the whole place shake with his heavy
tread.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s one of the best-hearted fellows
in existence,&#8221; said uncle Tom, looking at
me with a humorous twinkle in his eye.
&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad he&#8217;s come. I&#8217;ve been
wanting an opportunity to introduce you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s Teazer? his dog?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;His daughter. It&#8217;s his pet name for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Theresa&mdash;as handsome a girl as ever you
saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so bluff as her papa, perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not she. I rather think Dick assumes
that manner with strangers. He has an
idea that it makes people see he is a man
of the world&mdash;a practical, plain-spoken man
who is not to be humbugged. In reality,
any child could trick him. A big, honest
heart beats in that stout form, Charlie.
Don&#8217;t let his manner prejudice you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not easily prejudiced.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncle Dick returned to the bank punctually
at four, and came in, roaring out,
&#8220;What ho! House here, I say! Not
ready yet! &#8217;Sdeath, but I&#8217;ll be revenged!&#8221;
making at the same time so horrible a
face at me, that Mr. Spratling had to
squeeze his mouth into his coat-sleeves,
with his hands locked over the nape of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
his neck, to save the explosion of an
incontrollable yell.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was Braham&#8217;s style in his recititavos,&#8221;
said the old gentleman. &#8220;Did
you ever hear of Braham?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; I answered, thinking he
was joking me, &#8220;and of Isaac and Jacob
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said he to his brother, who at
that moment came out of his private
room, &#8220;here&#8217;s a young gentleman who
imagines that Braham lived in the time
of Isaac and Jacob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he didn&#8217;t, his forefathers did,&#8221;
replied Uncle Tom; at which retort, from
the head of the firm, both Mr. Curling
and Mr. Spratling laughed loudly, the
smaller salary being more boisterous than
the larger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Braham,&#8221; said uncle Dick, addressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
me, &#8220;was a great singer, who composed
the &#8216;Death of Nelson,&#8217; worthy, sir, of
Charles Dibdin. He was, besides, the
best <i>Isaac Mendoza</i> the world will ever
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes the phaeton,&#8221; cried uncle
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you asked me if I had
ever heard of Abraham,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fudge! Abraham, indeed! I am talking
of little Braham who used to sing&mdash;&#8221;
and to my infinite amusement, and to
his brother&#8217;s great concern, he struck an
attitude, clapped his hand on his heart,
and frowning at a framed advertisement
of the British Imperial Marine Insurance
Company, sang in a small clear tenor, the
first bars of &#8220;&#8217;Twas in Trafalgar&#8217;s bay!&#8221;
This done, he called out, &#8220;Now then,
gentlemen, let none of you pretend never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
to have heard of Braham,&#8221; marched to
the phaeton and climbed into the front
seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Braham is one of his heroes,&#8221; uncle
Tom whispered to me as we followed.
&#8220;They were friends, I believe, twenty-five
years ago. Dick was a good deal
among the players and literary men of
those days, and when he is in the vein,
his conversation is very amusing.&#8221;</p>

<p>We jumped into the phaeton, and drove
to Grove End.</p>

<p>My aunt and Conny gave uncle Dick a
hearty greeting. I confess I was surprised
to see how completely he altered his
manners when with the ladies; how courteous,
how affable he was, how agreeably
he talked. He tried to get up a laugh
against me, by telling them how I had
mistaken Braham the singer for Abraham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the patriarch; but whether it was that
I had my aunt&#8217;s and cousin&#8217;s sympathy,
or that they had never heard of Braham,
my big uncle&#8217;s well-meant attempt missed
fire. I gave him a look to let him know
that what laugh there was, was on my
side. Conny asked very affectionately
after Theresa.</p>

<p>&#8220;She wants to be tamed,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;She&#8217;s growing desperately wild.
Her latest amusement is pistol-shooting,
and I give you my word she is the
neatest shot that can be imagined. She
hangs a ball to a branch, and cuts the
thread eight times out of ten, at twenty
paces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a very singular pastime for a
young lady to indulge in,&#8221; exclaimed my
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should get her married,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
uncle Tom. &#8220;I wish you had brought
her with you. Here&#8217;s a cousin who
would be glad to know her.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tried to catch Conny&#8217;s eye, to let her
know that this suggestion of her papa&#8217;s
was entirely gratuitous, but she wouldn&#8217;t
look at me. It seemed to me, however,
that Mrs. Hargrave stared at her husband
somewhat more severely than his innocent
observation merited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when are you coming to see
us?&#8221; said uncle Dick, turning round and
facing me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be proud to make Theresa&#8217;s
acquaintance,&#8221; I answered, the idea suddenly
occurring to me that by feigning
to take an interest in my unknown relative,
I might arouse Conny&#8217;s jealousy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Name your day, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll settle that this evening,&#8221; interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
uncle Tom, who then offered
to take his brother to his bed-room, and
afterwards show him some singular roots
he had in his hothouses. So they left
the room. Conny followed them, &#8220;to
wait upon her uncle,&#8221; she said, and my
aunt and I were left alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Theresa,&#8221; she observed, &#8220;is a handsome,
dashing girl, but I don&#8217;t think
you&#8217;ll admire her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She seems to have a very manly
disposition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very; she&#8217;s all day long on horseback.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She should join a circus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I confess,&#8221; said my aunt, &#8220;I should
not care for Conny to possess her
accomplishments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Conny is a thorough woman, all
sweetness and tenderness.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>&#8220;And I daresay,&#8221; replied the gratified
mother, &#8220;would be thought by many
quite as pretty as her cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t conceive any girl prettier
than Conny. I hope I shan&#8217;t frighten
you,&#8221; I continued, carried away by my
feelings, &#8220;if I tell you that I am in love
with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really?&#8221; she exclaimed,
opening her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deeply in love with her, and I told
her so last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did she say?&#8221; inquired
my aunt eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she told me that I had not
given her time to fall in love with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But did she seem pleased? did she
seem gratified?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know. Sometimes I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
she was, and sometimes I thought she
wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, speaking for myself, Charlie,&#8221;
said my aunt, inclining her head forward,
and addressing me in her most confidential
manner, &#8220;I may tell you, you are welcome
to my consent, if you can succeed
in making her love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delighted as I was, I couldn&#8217;t be
amazed; for you must remember that
Conny had told me of her mother&#8217;s wishes
the evening before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not yet expressed my wishes
to my husband,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;as I
prefer to wait until you and Conny have
settled it between you. But I do not
doubt that he would be as gratified as
myself by the union of his child with the
son of his favourite brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s amiable and good enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
consent to anything that would give
happiness,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As to my father,&#8221; I continued, &#8220;it
would delight him to hear that I was to
be married to Conny. He is a great
advocate for marriages between cousins.
He considers that the dignity of a family
can only be sustained and transmitted by
the union of relations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Providing there is no madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course. Don&#8217;t you agree with
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Entirely. But what do you yourself
think of Conny? does she seem fond of
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She gave me leave to hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear that. And now,
as you are in love, you can be jealous;
and will therefore be able to tell me if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
you think her affections are engaged elsewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a most uncomfortable suggestion,&#8221;
I answered, uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think she cares about Mr.
Curling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried to find out&mdash;and were
I not in love with her, I should say,
No. But the mere idea makes me jealous,
and suspicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to think that she was attached
to that man,&#8221; said my aunt, &#8220;and so
took the bull by the horns, by ceasing
to invite him to see us. But I really
believe now, that what little nonsense
there was between them, is at an end.
It is impossible to suppose that a child
of mine could continue to care about so
insignificant a person; and certainly, since
your arrival, I have had no cause whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
to suspect that she any longer
thinks about him. If she has given you
encouragement, I am satisfied. Conny is
an honest girl, and would not dream of
accepting one man&#8217;s attention, while her
heart was secretly given to another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the subject of our conversation
entered the room, and drove us to talk
of something else.</p>

<p>Considering Conny knew I loved her,
considering, indeed, that I had as good
as proposed to her, I had rather expected
that she would manifest some little degree
of embarrassment on meeting my eyes,
that she would colour up, perhaps, when
I looked at her; in a word, that she
would have exhibited by her manner a
thorough consciousness of the tender
experience we shared. Do you understand
me, Eugenio? When you met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Dorothea, after you had squeezed her
hand, and muttered the statements you
desired to make in her ear, you were
quite satisfied to find her shy and even
reserved, peeping at you askance when
she thought you were not noticing, and
receiving your observations&mdash;uttered in a
very distant and polite tone of course,
before company&mdash;with a peculiar smile
and a remarkable little blush, both
which your heart opened to receive, as
the flower opens to the delicate dew, and
both which were inexpressibly delicious,
because they were unintelligible to all but
you. Now Conny thrilled me with no
such subtle and touching manifestations.
She made no difference in her treatment
of me. When my uncles returned, I got
her into a corner near the piano, and
talked cynicism. I was dreadfully sarcastic;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
sneered at everything; asked
satirical questions with acidulated grins;
quoted &#8220;Vanity Fair,&#8221; and was altogether
fearfully bitter. She appeared sometimes
amused and sometimes disconcerted by
my remarks; but I won&#8217;t be sure that
she heard everything I said. At last
she asked me if I didn&#8217;t feel well?</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; I exclaimed, &#8220;what
a dreadful question! Of course I am
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are bilious,&#8221; she said: &#8220;you
don&#8217;t take enough exercise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not bilious. As to exercise, I
hate walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you talk cheerfully?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you hate me,&#8221; I replied,
giving her a ghastly look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I told you last night that
I liked you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>&#8220;Liked!&#8221; I cried with immense contempt.
&#8220;I had rather be hated than
liked. I want to be loved,&#8221; I muttered
in a voice resembling that with which
Hamlet <i>pÃ¨re</i> is used to address his son
from under the stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;You promised you would not revert
to&mdash;to&mdash;that subject, until I gave you
leave,&#8221; she exclaimed, reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it. I must speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do try to be patient, <i>dear</i> Charlie,&#8221;
she whispered in her most winning voice,
with her sweetest smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; I gasped. &#8220;But oh, don&#8217;t treat
me as if I were only a nice young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made me no answer, but letting slip
her little hand, caught hold of my wrist,
and gave it a squeeze. Eugenio, &#8217;twas
like taking chloroform. All heaven opened
upon me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>&#8220;Dinner is served,&#8221; said a servant at
the door.</p>

<p>I gave Conny my arm, and followed
the others into the dining-room.</p>
